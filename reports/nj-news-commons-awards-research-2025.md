## About the Awards Program

### Overview

The **Excellence in NJ Local News Awards** is an annual program run by the **Center for Cooperative Media** at **Montclair State University**. The awards recognize outstanding journalism by NJ News Commons members.

- **Launched:** 2018 (for 2017 work)
- **Current Year:** 8th annual awards program

### Funding Sources

- Montclair State University
- John S. and James L. Knight Foundation
- Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation
- Democracy Fund
- Abrams Foundation

### Current Format

The program moved away from specific categories to an open, inclusive submission process based on feedback from ethnic and community media partners. Members now:

- Submit their best work
- Submit their most challenging endeavor
- Submit any project they're proud of from the year
- Explain why they think it deserves recognition

### Prizes and Recognition

Each winner receives:
- **$100 gift card**
- **Award certificate** signed by the Center
- **Digital award badge** for website/print publication
- **Explanation** of why their submission was selected
- **Public recognition** at awards ceremony

### Eligibility Requirements

**Who Can Enter:**
- New Jersey news and information providers
- Must be members of the NJ News Commons (membership is free)
- Must adhere to professional journalism ethics codes

**Work Requirements:**
- All reporting entries must focus on local topics related to New Jersey
- Must have been published, broadcast, or otherwise disseminated in the relevant calendar year

**What Does NOT Qualify:**
- Unpublished manuscripts
- Classroom exercises (unless also published outside of class)
- Unaired news broadcasts
- Work not focused on New Jersey topics
- Incomplete entries

### Judging Process

The Center moved to internal evaluation by Center staff, which allows them to:
