# Horizon Foundation for New Jersey - ECM Sponsorship Research Report

**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Event:** Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon
**Event Date:** February 26, 2026
**Location:** New Jersey
**Research Focus:** Sponsorship opportunities for ECM event (grant cycle closed until June 1)

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** While The Horizon Foundation for New Jersey's traditional grant cycle is closed until June 1, 2026, there are **two distinct pathways** for engaging with Horizon:

1. **Corporate Sponsorship** (Immediate opportunity) - Managed through Horizon BCBS corporate affairs, separate from foundation grants
2. **Foundation Grant** (Future opportunity) - Standard grant application for June 1 cycle and beyond

**Recommendation:** Pursue a dual-track approach:
- **Track 1:** Immediate outreach to Horizon BCBS Corporate Affairs/Sponsorship team for Feb 26 event
- **Track 2:** Prepare foundation grant concept for June 1, 2026 deadline for future ECM initiatives

**Strong Alignment:** Horizon's demonstrated commitment to health equity, multicultural health initiatives, and diverse community engagement makes them an excellent fit for an Ethnic and Community Media event.

## Assessment: Pursue Corporate Sponsorship Now + Foundation Grant Later?

### Analysis and Recommendation

**YES - Dual-Track Approach is Optimal**

### Track 1: Corporate Sponsorship (Feb 26 Event)

**Viability: MEDIUM TO HIGH**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Strong mission alignment (health equity, diverse communities, multicultural health)
- ✅ Precedent for corporate event sponsorships (Red Bulls Hispanic Heritage Night, etc.)
- ✅ Managed by separate team from foundation grants (may have different timelines/flexibility)
- ✅ Positive Impact handles 100+ activations annually (streamlined process)
- ✅ Event timing allows for activation (Feb 26 = 7 weeks out, tight but feasible)
- ✅ Clear value proposition (access to trusted ethnic media outlets reaching diverse members)

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ Short timeline (less than 2 months to Feb 26)
- ⚠️ Corporate sponsorship budgets may already be allocated for 2026
- ⚠️ Unknown internal approval process timeline
- ⚠️ May need to go through Positive Impact (additional layer)

**Likelihood of Success:**
- **If contacted this week (early January):** 50-60% chance
- **If strong connection made to right contact:** Could increase to 70%+
- **Sponsorship level:** More likely $5K-$25K corporate sponsorship than major $50K+ investment on short timeline

**Action Items:**
1. **This week (Jan 6-10):** Send sponsorship inquiry to:
   - Ulises Diaz (SVP Government & Community Affairs)
   - Jonathan Pearson (Director CSR/Foundation Executive Director)
   - Positive Impact (info@positiveimpact.net)
2. **Follow-up call:** Request within 48 hours of email
3. **Proposal ready:** Have sponsorship benefits/levels ready to send
4. **Decision timeline:** Request decision by end of January for Feb 26 event

### Track 2: Foundation Grant (June 1 Cycle)

**Viability: HIGH**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Excellent mission alignment (health equity, multicultural health, community engagement)
- ✅ Precedent: Documentary funding ($50K to Latino Leadership Alliance)
- ✅ Clear health focus area (communication, literacy, access, disparities)
- ✅ Can develop robust concept with measurable health outcomes
- ✅ Time to build relationship and refine proposal
- ✅ Grant range ($10K-$50K) appropriate for ECM programming

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ Competitive process (56 grants awarded in recent round, unknown total applications)
- ⚠️ Requires 501(c)(3) status and current audit
- ⚠️ Must demonstrate evidence-based approach and measurable outcomes
- ⚠️ Program must serve NJ communities (ensure geographic alignment)

**Likelihood of Success:**
- **With strong concept:** 60-70% chance
- **With pre-submission consultation:** Could increase to 75%+
- **If Feb event builds relationship:** Could significantly increase odds

**Action Items:**
1. **January-February:** Develop concept paper
   - Focus on health literacy, communication, access to health information
   - Identify measurable outcomes (reach, engagement, health knowledge)
   - Determine fiscal sponsor if needed (if ECM org doesn't have 501(c)(3))
2. **March-April:** Send concept to Foundation_Info@horizonblue.com
   - Request consultation with Program Officer
   - Get feedback before full application
3. **May:** Finalize application based on feedback
4. **June 1:** Submit full application (verify exact deadline)
5. **Summer/Fall:** Decision notification

### Strategic Integration of Both Tracks

**How February Event Can Support June Grant:**

1. **Relationship Building:**
   - Feb event puts ECM on Horizon's radar
   - Face-to-face interaction with leadership (if they attend/speak)
   - Demonstrates organizational capacity and professionalism

2. **Proof of Concept:**
   - Event success = demonstration of ECM's reach and convening power
   - Media coverage = evidence of community trust and engagement
   - Can reference event in June grant application as track record

3. **Partnership Development:**
   - Feb sponsorship creates entry point for deeper collaboration
   - Even small corporate sponsorship ($5K-$10K) builds relationship
   - Opens door for Program Officer conversation: "We're already partners"

4. **Needs Assessment:**
   - Event can surface health information needs in ethnic communities
   - Attendee feedback can inform grant proposal framing
   - Creates data/anecdotes for application

**Potential Integrated Pitch:**
- "We're seeking corporate sponsorship for our Feb 26 ECM celebration, AND we're developing a concept for a June grant application to create an ongoing Ethnic Media Health Equity Initiative. We see February as the launch of a longer-term partnership."

### Risk Mitigation

**If Corporate Sponsorship Doesn't Come Through:**
- Event proceeds without Horizon (other sponsors sought)
- Still pursue June grant based on mission alignment
- Use event itself as demonstration of need and ECM's role

**If Grant Not Awarded in June Cycle:**
- Re-apply in next cycle with stronger proposal
- Maintain corporate sponsorship relationship for future events
- Explore other Horizon opportunities (in-kind, employee engagement, themed grants)

### Return on Investment for Dual-Track Approach

**Time Investment:**
- Corporate sponsorship outreach: 5-10 hours (emails, calls, proposal)
- Grant concept development: 20-30 hours (research, writing, consultation)
- Total: 25-40 hours over 5 months

**Potential Financial Return:**
- Corporate sponsorship: $5,000-$25,000 (one-time, Feb 2026)
- Foundation grant: $10,000-$50,000 (ongoing program, 2026-2027)
- Combined potential: $15,000-$75,000
- Multi-year potential: If grant leads to sustained partnership, $50K-$200K+ over 3-5 years

**Non-Financial Value:**
- Partnership with state's largest health insurer (brand credibility)
- Access to health equity resources for ethnic communities
- Platform for ECM as trusted health messengers
- Potential for in-kind support (speakers, materials, screenings)
- Model for other corporate-community media partnerships
