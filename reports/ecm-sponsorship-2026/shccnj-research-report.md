## TALKING POINTS & PITCH ANGLES

### Customized Pitch for SHCCNJ

**1. "Your Members' Stories Deserve to Be Told"**
"SHCCNJ represents 120,000 Hispanic-owned businesses contributing $100+ billion to NJ's economy. The ethnic and community media outlets at this luncheon are the ones telling those stories - in Spanish, in Portuguese, in the languages your members' communities speak. This partnership connects you directly with the media covering your members' success."

**2. "Carlos Medina Knows the Power of Ethnic Media"**
"As the host of Que Pasa NJ on PBS, Carlos understands how ethnic media amplifies community voices. The ECM Celebration Luncheon brings together 140+ outlets doing similar work across all of NJ's diverse communities. It's a natural extension of the visibility SHCCNJ already creates through media."

**3. "From Familia to Familia"**
"SHCCNJ's 'familia' concept - where 45% of members are non-Hispanic but share your mission - mirrors the ECM ecosystem. These outlets serve African, African American, Asian, European, Latino, and Middle Eastern communities. Supporting ECM means supporting the entire multicultural fabric that makes NJ's economy strong."

**4. "Business Development Opportunity"**
"This isn't just a sponsorship - it's a business development opportunity. Your members can meet editors, publishers, and journalists who control advertising and sponsored content decisions. For businesses looking to reach ethnic markets, these are the gatekeepers."

**5. "Advocacy Alignment"**
"SHCCNJ serves as 'an active and visible advocate for small business in the political process.' ECM outlets cover policy, advocate for their communities, and bring diverse perspectives to lawmakers. Supporting ECM is supporting allies in advocacy."

**6. "2026 Visibility Strategy"**
"You're already leveraging World Cup 2026 for business opportunities. The ECM Luncheon in February sets up year-long partnerships with media outlets that will cover your World Cup initiatives, member successes, and programs throughout 2026."

**7. "Partnership, Not Just Sponsorship"**
"Like your partnerships with Valencia Media Group, NJCU, and NJEDA, this is a strategic relationship. ECM outlets can cover your events, feature your members, and amplify your economic impact story. In return, you get logo placement, speaking opportunities, and access to decision-makers."

### Framing by Sponsorship Level

**If they can only do small sponsorship:**
- "Even a supporting level sponsorship puts SHCCNJ's logo in front of 140+ media outlets"
- "Think of it as advertising to the advertisers - these outlets need to know about SHCCNJ"
- "Small investment, big visibility with media decision-makers"

**If pitching larger sponsorship:**
- "Title or presenting sponsorship positions SHCCNJ as the leading voice for business-media partnerships"
- "Speaking opportunity for Carlos Medina to discuss Que Pasa NJ and the importance of ethnic media"
- "VIP table for SHCCNJ board and key members to network directly with publishers and editors"
- "Year-long media partnership with outlets that reach your communities"

## COMPETITIVE/ALTERNATIVE CONTEXT

### Other Organizations They May Compare To

If SHCCNJ is considering multiple sponsorship opportunities, they might compare ECM to:

1. **Business Networking Events**
   - ECM Advantage: Direct media access, not just general networking

2. **Industry Trade Shows**
   - ECM Advantage: Unique audience of 140+ media outlets, cannot access elsewhere

3. **Political/Advocacy Events**
   - ECM Advantage: Media are the ones who amplify political advocacy

4. **Diversity & Inclusion Events**
   - ECM Advantage: Celebrates actual diverse media, not just talking about diversity

### Why ECM Stands Out

- **Unique Access:** Only event bringing together all NJ ethnic/community media
- **Strategic Timing:** February (early year visibility) vs. crowded fall calendar
- **Mission Alignment:** Not generic sponsorship, but values-aligned partnership
- **Reciprocal Value:** Media coverage potential for SHCCNJ throughout 2026
- **Decision-Maker Access:** Publishers, editors, ad directors in one room

---

## POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### Objection: "We don't have budget"
**Response:**
- "What if we explore a partnership beyond financial sponsorship?"
- "Could SHCCNJ provide in-kind support - venue access, member outreach, promotional support?"
- "Even a small supporting sponsorship gets your logo and mission in front of 140 outlets"
- "Think of this as marketing budget - you're advertising to the people who control advertising"

### Objection: "We already support media through our PBS partnership"
**Response:**
- "That's exactly why this makes sense! Carlos's PBS work shows you understand media's value"
- "ECM expands that to 140+ outlets serving all of NJ's diverse communities"
- "This complements Que Pasa NJ by supporting the broader ethnic media ecosystem"

### Objection: "February is too soon / too busy"
**Response:**
- "I understand timing is tight. What level of involvement works for February?"
- "Could we secure commitment now for SHCCNJ logo and recognition, with deeper activation later?"
- "Even if you can't send large delegation, having SHCCNJ as a sponsor signals values alignment"

### Objection: "How does this benefit our members specifically?"
**Response:**
- "Three ways: 1) Direct networking access to media outlets for advertising, 2) Coverage opportunities for member success stories, 3) Visibility with lawmakers and agencies who support small business"
- "Would it help to bring specific members to the event to meet relevant media outlets?"
- "We can create member-focused activation - 'SHCCNJ Member Showcase' where media meet your businesses"

### Objection: "We need to focus on Hispanic-specific initiatives"
**Response:**
- "NJ has dozens of Hispanic/Latino media outlets that will be at this event"
- "Many ECM outlets specifically serve the communities your members serve"
- "Your 'familia' approach includes 45% non-Hispanic members - ECM's diversity mirrors that"
- "Supporting all ethnic media creates ecosystem that benefits Latino media too"

### Objection: "We don't know enough about ECM / Center for Cooperative Media"
**Response:**
- "The Center for Cooperative Media is at Montclair State - similar to your NJCU partnership"
- "This is the first event of its kind, bringing together all 140+ NJ ethnic media outlets"
- "Happy to arrange intro call with Center leadership to discuss partnership"
- "Would a one-pager with event details and sponsorship benefits be helpful?"

✅ Clear member value proposition (access to advertising opportunities)
✅ "Familia" culture aligns with ECM's inclusive approach

**Likelihood of Partnership: MEDIUM-HIGH**

With proper follow-up and clear value proposition emphasizing member benefits and media access, SHCCNJ is likely to engage. The Carlos Medina PBS connection is a strong hook.

### Recommended Next Steps

   - Send follow-up email to chamber@shccnj.org
   - Call (201) 935-0035 to confirm email received
   - Prepare one-pager with sponsorship benefits

- **Emphasis:** Logo, social media promotion, table for members, speaking opportunity for Carlos Medina
- **Fallback:** Supporting level with potential for increased partnership in future years
- **Creative option:** In-kind partnership (venue, promotion, member outreach) + smaller financial contribution

### Key Success Factors

1. **Personalization** - Reference Carlos Medina's PBS work specifically
2. **Member Value** - Emphasize business development, not just visibility
3. **Partnership Language** - Use "partnership" not "sponsorship" where possible
4. **Reciprocal Benefits** - Highlight what ECM outlets can do for SHCCNJ
