# The Merck Company Foundation - ECM Event Sponsorship Research Report

**Research Date:** January 6, 2026
**Event:** Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon
**Event Date:** February 26, 2026
**Location:** New Jersey

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Fit Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The Merck Company Foundation presents a promising but challenging sponsorship opportunity for the ECM celebration luncheon. While the Foundation does NOT accept unsolicited proposals (explaining the user's observation of "no way to submit"), there are alternative pathways through their Neighbor of Choice program, employee engagement opportunities, and direct outreach. Merck's strong New Jersey presence (headquartered in Rahway, NJ), commitment to health equity and diversity, and history of supporting community events make them a strategic target.

**Key Challenge:** No open application process
**Key Opportunity:** NJ-based company with strong community engagement mission and documented support for diversity, media training, and community events

## RECOMMENDED OUTREACH APPROACH

### Phase 1: Initial Contact (Early January 2026)

**Email to Leslie Hardy:**

Subject: Request for Guidance - NJ Community Media Celebration Event (Feb 26)

Dear Ms. Hardy,

I am writing to introduce [Organization Name] and seek your guidance regarding potential Merck Foundation support for our Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026, in New Jersey.

**Event Overview:**
Our ECM Celebration Luncheon honors the vital role that ethnic and community media play in serving New Jersey's diverse communities. These media outlets serve as trusted sources of health information, cultural connection, and civic engagement for underserved populations throughout the state.

**Alignment with Merck Foundation Mission:**
This event aligns closely with several Merck Foundation priorities:

1. **Health Equity & Communication:** Ethnic media outlets serve as critical health communication channels, reaching populations that mainstream media often miss. As Merck Foundation's own international Health Media Training program recognizes, "media has the power to shape mindsets and create a culture shift" in addressing health disparities.

2. **New Jersey Community Impact:** As a company headquartered in Rahway, Merck has deep roots in New Jersey. This event celebrates media serving the diverse communities that make up Merck's home state.

3. **Culturally Responsive Engagement:** Just as Merck's Alliance for Equity in Cancer Care emphasizes culturally responsive care, ethnic media provide culturally responsive information that reaches immigrant, minority, and underserved communities.

4. **Employee Engagement Opportunity:** The event offers opportunities for Merck employee participation, speaker contributions, or attendance.

**Our Request:**
We understand that the Merck Foundation does not accept unsolicited proposals. We would be grateful for:
- A brief conversation to explore whether this event aligns with Foundation priorities
- Guidance on the most appropriate pathway for potential support (Neighbor of Choice program, corporate sponsorship, or other mechanisms)
- Information about application timelines and requirements

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss how supporting ethnic and community media amplifies Merck's health equity mission by strengthening the communication channels that reach underserved populations.

Thank you for considering this request. I would be happy to provide additional information or schedule a call at your convenience.

Sincerely,
[Name]
[Organization]
[Contact Information]

## KEY TALKING POINTS & ALIGNMENT MESSAGING

### 1. Ethnic Media as Health Equity Infrastructure
**Merck's Language:** "Support efforts to overcome barriers that many people—especially those living in marginalized and underserved communities—face in accessing high-quality, equitable health care."

**Your Message:** "Ethnic and community media serve as critical health communication infrastructure, reaching immigrant, minority, and limited-English-proficiency populations who face the greatest barriers to health information. Supporting these media outlets directly advances Merck's health equity mission."

### 2. New Jersey Community Connection
**Merck's Language:** "Build stronger communities where our employees live and work."

**Your Message:** "Since 1957, Merck has called Rahway, New Jersey home. This event celebrates the diverse media voices serving New Jersey's communities—the same communities where Merck employees and their families live. Following Merck's expansion throughout NJ after the Schering-Plough merger, supporting statewide ethnic media honors that broadened commitment."

### 3. Culturally Responsive Communication
**Merck's Language:** "High-quality, culturally responsive care" (from cancer and cardiac care initiatives)

**Your Message:** "Just as culturally responsive healthcare requires understanding patients' languages, customs, and communities, culturally responsive health communication requires media that reflect those same cultural contexts. Ethnic media provide that essential cultural bridge."

### 4. Media's Power to Shape Health Outcomes
**Merck's Language:** (From Merck Foundation CEO) "Media has the power to shape mindsets and create a culture shift."

**Your Message:** "Merck Foundation's Health Media Training program demonstrates the Foundation's recognition that journalists drive health behavior change. This event celebrates the journalists who daily report to communities experiencing the highest rates of chronic diseases—diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer—that are Merck Foundation's focus areas."

### 5. Community Engagement & Employee Connection
**Merck's Language:** "Organizations must be located within 15 miles of a participating site and requests must include Merck employee engagement opportunities."

**Your Message:** "This NJ-based event offers multiple Merck employee engagement opportunities: attendance, speaking roles highlighting Merck's health equity work, volunteering, and networking with community leaders. We would be honored to feature a Merck representative speaking about the company's commitment to health communication and equity."

### 6. Trusted Messengers in Underserved Communities
**Merck's Language:** "Advance equitable access to health... serving those living in poverty, in underrepresented ethnic groups, who have diverse gender identities and/or sexual orientations."

**Your Message:** "Ethnic and community media are trusted messengers in precisely the populations Merck Foundation prioritizes. A Korean-language newspaper, Spanish-language radio station, or South Asian community magazine reaches populations that mainstream health campaigns often miss—and delivers health messages from sources those communities trust."

### 7. Amplifying Merck's Health Initiatives
**Merck's Language:** "Investing in innovative solutions to advance equitable access to health."

**Your Message:** "Supporting this event creates a multiplier effect for Merck's health equity work. The attending media outlets collectively reach hundreds of thousands of New Jersey residents in diverse communities—creating channels to amplify messages about diabetes management, cancer screening, cardiovascular health, and other Merck Foundation priority areas."

### 8. Neighbor of Choice Philosophy
**Merck's Language:** "Address community and quality of life issues in communities where Merck has a major presence."

**Your Message:** "Media diversity is a quality-of-life issue. When communities see themselves reflected in local media—their languages, cultures, and concerns taken seriously—it strengthens civic engagement and community cohesion. Celebrating these media outlets strengthens the fabric of New Jersey communities where Merck has chosen to be a neighbor."

## FIT ASSESSMENT: MEDIUM-HIGH

### Strengths (Why This Could Work)

✅ **Geographic Alignment:** Merck headquarters in Rahway, NJ; expanded NJ presence post-merger
✅ **Mission Alignment:** Health equity, diversity, underserved communities
✅ **Demonstrated Media Recognition:** International health media training program
✅ **Community Event History:** Recent funding for NJ community events (fundraising galas)
✅ **Neighbor of Choice Expansion:** 2012 expansion throughout NJ state
✅ **Health Communication Focus:** Recognition that media shapes health behaviors
✅ **Culturally Responsive Care Commitment:** Ethnic media = culturally responsive communication
✅ **Employee Engagement Opportunity:** Event offers multiple engagement pathways

### Challenges (Why This Is Difficult)

⚠️ **No Unsolicited Proposals:** Biggest barrier; requires creative outreach
⚠️ **Timing:** Event is Feb 26, 2026 (7 weeks away)—may be too short notice
⚠️ **Health Focus:** Foundation primarily health-focused; media celebration is indirect health connection
⚠️ **Application Cycles:** Major programs have closed application windows
⚠️ **Neighbor of Choice Status:** Unclear if currently accepting applications
⚠️ **Cold Contact:** No existing relationship or employee connection

### Mitigating Factors

🔧 **Strong Case for Health Connection:** Ethnic media as health communication infrastructure
🔧 **Recent Event Sponsorship:** Q2 2025 funded fundraiser event shows active interest
🔧 **Foundation Leadership:** Leslie Hardy has public health background (Johns Hopkins MHS)
🔧 **Corporate Sponsorship Alternative:** Separate from Foundation pathway
🔧 **Relationship Building:** Even if Feb event doesn't receive support, establishes connection for future

## CONCLUSION & FINAL ASSESSMENT

The Merck Company Foundation represents a **strategically valuable but challenging** sponsorship target for the ECM celebration luncheon. The alignment is strong—Merck's commitment to health equity, diversity, culturally responsive programs, and New Jersey community engagement all support the case for partnership. The Foundation's own recognition of media's power to shape health outcomes (through their international media training programs) provides powerful precedent.

However, the **"no unsolicited proposals" policy and tight timeline** (7 weeks to event) present significant barriers. Success will depend on:

1. **Making the health equity connection explicit:** Positioning ethnic media not as a cultural celebration but as critical health communication infrastructure
2. **Leveraging NJ connection:** Emphasizing Merck's Rahway roots and expanded NJ presence
3. **Direct outreach to decision-maker:** Going straight to Leslie Hardy rather than hoping for a submission portal
4. **Flexibility on support level:** Being open to smaller grants, in-kind support, or future partnership
5. **Employee engagement angle:** Creating opportunities for Merck staff involvement

**Recommended Approach Priority:**
1. **FIRST:** Direct email to Leslie Hardy (highest likelihood pathway)
2. **SECOND:** Phone follow-up if no response (shows serious intent)
3. **THIRD:** Corporate sponsorship pathway if Foundation unavailable (alternative budget source)
4. **FOURTH:** Relationship building for future even if February 2026 doesn't materialize

**Realistic Outcome Scenarios:**

- **Best case (20% likelihood):** $5K-$25K grant or sponsorship for Feb 2026 event through expedited Neighbor of Choice or corporate sponsorship pathway
- **Good case (35% likelihood):** Merck representative attends event, no financial support but relationship established for 2027
- **Moderate case (30% likelihood):** Referral to corporate sponsorship team with longer timeline for consideration
- **No response (15% likelihood):** No reply to outreach attempts

**Even if February 2026 support doesn't materialize, the outreach effort is valuable for:**
- Introducing organization to major NJ foundation
- Establishing foundation for 2027 event support
- Potential programmatic partnership on health media initiatives
- Learning about application processes and priorities for future proposals

**Bottom Line:** Worth pursuing aggressively given strong mission alignment and NJ connection, but prepare for possibility that timeline is too tight. Focus on relationship building for long-term partnership potential.
