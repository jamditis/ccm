## EMAIL TEMPLATE (Customize bracketed sections)

Dear Ms. Hardy,

I am writing to introduce [**YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME**] and seek your guidance regarding potential Merck Foundation support for our Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026, in [**EVENT LOCATION, NJ**].

**Event Overview:**

Our ECM Celebration Luncheon honors the vital role that ethnic and community media play in serving New Jersey's diverse communities. We expect [**NUMBER**] attendees representing [**NUMBER**] media outlets that collectively reach [**NUMBER**] New Jersey residents across [**LIST KEY LANGUAGE/ETHNIC COMMUNITIES: e.g., Spanish-speaking, Korean, South Asian, African immigrant, etc.**] communities.

These media outlets serve as trusted sources of health information, cultural connection, and civic engagement for underserved populations throughout the state—many of whom face the greatest barriers to accessing mainstream health communication.

**Alignment with Merck Foundation Mission:**

This event aligns closely with several Merck Foundation priorities:

**1. Health Equity Through Media Communication**

Ethnic and community media serve as critical health communication infrastructure, reaching populations experiencing the highest rates of chronic diseases that are Merck Foundation focus areas—diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. When health messages appear in a trusted community newspaper, radio program, or digital outlet—in the audience's own language and cultural context—they have far greater impact than mainstream campaigns.

Your Foundation's own international Health Media Training program demonstrates Merck's recognition that, as Dr. Rasha Kelej states, "media has the power to shape mindsets and create a culture shift." The journalists we are celebrating do exactly this work daily—educating New Jersey's diverse communities about health screening, chronic disease management, and preventive care.

**2. New Jersey Community Impact**

As a company headquartered in Rahway since 1957, Merck has deep roots in New Jersey. Following the Schering-Plough merger, Merck expanded its Neighbor of Choice program throughout the state, reflecting your broadened commitment to New Jersey communities.

This event celebrates media serving the diverse communities that make up Merck's home state—the same communities where Merck employees and their families live and work.

**3. Culturally Responsive Engagement**

Just as Merck's Alliance for Equity in Cancer Care and Collaborative for Equity in Cardiac Care emphasize culturally responsive care, ethnic media provide culturally responsive health information. A Spanish-language radio health segment, a Korean newspaper article about diabetes screening, or a South Asian digital outlet's COVID-19 coverage reach populations in ways that resonate with their cultural contexts and lived experiences.

**4. Merck Employee Engagement Opportunity**

The event offers several opportunities for Merck employee participation:
- [**CUSTOMIZE: Speaking role highlighting Merck's health equity work**]
- [**CUSTOMIZE: Attendance and networking with community media leaders**]
- [**CUSTOMIZE: Volunteer opportunities**]
- [**CUSTOMIZE: Other engagement options**]

We would be honored to feature a Merck representative speaking about [**CUSTOMIZE: e.g., "the company's commitment to health communication equity" or "Merck's work in advancing culturally responsive health programs"**].

**Our Request:**

We understand that the Merck Foundation does not accept unsolicited proposals. Given the strong alignment between this event and Merck Foundation's health equity mission, we would be grateful for:

- A brief conversation to explore whether this event aligns with current Foundation priorities
- Guidance on the most appropriate pathway for potential support (such as the Neighbor of Choice program, corporate sponsorship, or other mechanisms)
- Information about application requirements and timelines

We recognize that February 26th is approaching quickly, and we are flexible regarding the level and form of support. Even if financial sponsorship is not feasible on this timeline, we would welcome:
- Merck representative attendance or speaking participation
- In-kind support
- Guidance for future partnership opportunities

**Why This Matters:**

Supporting ethnic and community media amplifies Merck's health equity mission by strengthening the communication channels that reach the underserved populations your Foundation prioritizes. These media outlets are trusted messengers in precisely the communities—immigrants, limited-English speakers, minority populations—who face the greatest health disparities.

[**OPTIONAL - Add if you have compelling data:**
- "Participating media outlets reach an estimated [NUMBER] New Jersey residents weekly"
- "X% of attendees serve communities where [relevant health statistic]"
- "Media represented include outlets serving communities with X% higher rates of [disease relevant to Merck]"
**]

I would be happy to provide additional information, including detailed event plans, participating media outlet profiles, health communication impact data, and sponsorship recognition benefits. I welcome the opportunity to schedule a call at your convenience.

Thank you for considering this request and for Merck Foundation's continued commitment to advancing health equity in New Jersey and beyond.

Sincerely,

[**YOUR NAME**]
[**YOUR TITLE**]
[**YOUR ORGANIZATION**]
[**YOUR EMAIL**]
[**YOUR PHONE**]
