## Assessment of Fit for ECM Celebration Luncheon

### OVERALL FIT: HIGH

### Alignment Factors (Strengths)

**1. Mission Alignment (Excellent)**
- AACCNJ explicitly supports Black and ethnic media
- Maintains directory of Black-owned media outlets
- States every member should have Black Press "on speed dial"
- Advocates for visibility of Black businesses - ECM does the same for ethnic communities

**2. Track Record (Strong)**
- History of co-sponsoring community events
- Partners with media (PBS "Pathway to Success", radio show)
- Building media production studio as part of Transformation Center
- Comfortable with event partnerships (Gala, conferences, symposiums)

**3. Values Alignment (Excellent)**
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values
- Community empowerment focus
- Support for underserved communities
- Advocacy for fair representation and voice

**4. Timing (Good)**
- ECM event on Feb 26, 2026
- Their Gala is in mid-February (likely week of Feb 9-16)
- Close proximity could work for or against (fatigue vs. momentum)
- Different enough in focus to avoid direct competition

**5. Geographic Relevance (Perfect)**
- Both are New Jersey-focused
- ECM event in NJ, AACCNJ serves entire state
- Natural constituency overlap

**6. Network Synergy (Excellent)**
- Dr. Harmon's extensive board positions could provide additional connections
- Access to 800+ chamber members
- Connection to 124,000+ Black-owned businesses
- Relationships with major corporations (PSEG, Truist, Port Authority, NJEDA)

### Potential Challenges

**1. Timing Proximity**
- Their major gala is likely 1-2 weeks before ECM event
- May have budget fatigue or competing priorities
- **Mitigation:** Position as complementary, not competing; smaller ask than their own gala

**2. Budget Allocation**
- May have already allocated February budget to their own Gala
- **Mitigation:** Flexible sponsorship levels; in-kind options; co-promotion opportunities

**3. Specificity of Mission**
- Primarily focused on African American business community
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize broader ethnic media representation, Black media as key ECM constituency

## Talking Points for Outreach

### Opening: Shared Mission
"AACCNJ has been a powerful voice for Black-owned media in New Jersey. The ECM Celebration Luncheon brings together the entire ethnic media ecosystem - Black, Latino, Asian American, Middle Eastern, and more - to celebrate the crucial role we all play in serving underserved communities."

### Key Messages

**1. This Aligns with Your Stated Values**
"You've said every chamber member should have a Black Press outlet on speed dial. This event puts your members in a room with not just Black media, but the full spectrum of ethnic media serving diverse communities across New Jersey."

**2. Extend Your Media Infrastructure Work**
"You're building a media production studio as part of the Transformation Center. Sponsoring ECM connects you to the media professionals who serve the exact communities you're trying to economically empower."

**3. Member Value Proposition**
"Your 800+ members and the 124,000+ Black-owned businesses you represent need media access. ECM sponsorship gives them connections to dozens of ethnic media outlets - expanding their reach beyond traditional Black Press to Asian, Latino, Middle Eastern, and other ethnic communities."

**4. Coalition Building**
"As the only accredited African American chamber in the entire U.S., you're a leader. Sponsoring ECM positions AACCNJ as building bridges across ALL ethnic communities, strengthening your coalition for policy advocacy and economic justice."

**5. Low Lift, High Impact**
"Unlike producing your own event, this is a turnkey opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to ethnic media. And the timing - just after your Gala - means you can invite the same corporate partners to another high-value networking opportunity."

**6. Dr. Harmon's Platform**
"This could be an opportunity for Dr. Harmon to speak about the importance of ethnic media in economic empowerment - extending his thought leadership from the Empowerment Hour radio show to a broader audience."

**7. It's Not Just Sponsorship - It's Partnership**
"We're not just asking for funding. We want AACCNJ's voice at the table, your perspective in the program, and your members to benefit from connections with ethnic media owners and executives."

### Addressing Potential Objections

**Objection: "We just had our Gala, budget is tight"**
**Response:** "We understand. That's why we have flexible tiers including in-kind options. Even a co-promotion partnership where we cross-promote both events creates value for both of us."

**Objection: "Our focus is African American businesses, not all ethnic media"**
**Response:** "Black media is a cornerstone of ECM. But economic empowerment doesn't happen in silos. Latino media can help Black businesses reach Latino customers. Asian media can spotlight Black entrepreneurs. This is about building the coalition that lifts all communities."

**Objection: "We need to see the value for our members"**
**Response:** "Fair question. Here's the concrete value: Your members get access to 30-40 ethnic media outlets for potential coverage. They get networking with media owners who can tell their stories. They get visibility in communities they might not otherwise reach. And AACCNJ gets recognized as the organization that made it happen."

**Objection: "We don't know much about ethnic media beyond Black Press"**
**Response:** "That's exactly why this partnership is valuable. We can educate your team and members on the broader ethnic media landscape. Think of it as extending your media toolkit."
