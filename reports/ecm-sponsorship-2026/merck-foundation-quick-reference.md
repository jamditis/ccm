# Merck Foundation - Quick Reference Guide
## ECM Event Sponsorship (Feb 26, 2026)

---

This is stated explicitly on their website, explaining why there's no online application portal.

---

## FIT ASSESSMENT: MEDIUM-HIGH ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Why This Could Work ✅
- Headquartered in Rahway, NJ (local connection)
- $24M+ annual giving; over $1B total since 1957
- Strong commitment to health equity & diversity

- "Media has power to shape mindsets" - Foundation CEO quote
- Neighbor of Choice program expanded throughout NJ in 2012

### Challenges ⚠️
- No unsolicited proposals accepted
- 7 weeks to event (tight timeline)
- Primarily health-focused (need to make media → health connection)
- Cold contact (no existing relationship)

---

## ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS

### 1. Neighbor of Choice (NOC) Program ⭐ BEST FIT
- **Grants:** Up to $150,000
- **Eligibility:** Within 15 miles of Merck site ✓ (NJ qualifies)
- **Focus:** Health, education, environmental sustainability
- **Required:** Merck employee engagement opportunities
- **Status:** Unknown if currently accepting applications (ASK LESLIE HARDY)

### 2. Corporate Sponsorship (Separate from Foundation)

- May have different timeline/requirements

### 3. Employee Engagement
- Dollars for Doers: $500 for 40+ volunteer hours

## KEY TALKING POINTS

### 1. ETHNIC MEDIA = HEALTH EQUITY INFRASTRUCTURE
"Ethnic media serve as critical health communication channels reaching the underserved populations that Merck Foundation prioritizes—immigrants, limited-English speakers, minority communities facing highest rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer."

### 2. NEW JERSEY COMMUNITY CONNECTION
"Merck has called Rahway home since 1957. This event celebrates media serving the diverse NJ communities where Merck employees and their families live."

### 3. MERCK ALREADY RECOGNIZES MEDIA'S POWER
"Merck Foundation's own Health Media Training program (3,700+ journalists trained) demonstrates your recognition that 'media has the power to shape mindsets and create culture shift' in health. This event celebrates journalists doing exactly that work in New Jersey's diverse communities."

### 4. CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE COMMUNICATION
"Just as Merck's Alliance for Equity in Cancer Care emphasizes culturally responsive care, ethnic media provide culturally responsive health information—in patients' own languages, reflecting their cultural contexts."

### 5. EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITY
"Event offers multiple Merck employee engagement options: speaking about Merck's health equity work, attendance, volunteering, networking with community leaders."

## WHAT TO AVOID

❌ Don't submit through generic contact forms (they don't accept unsolicited proposals)
❌ Don't frame as "media celebration" alone—emphasize HEALTH COMMUNICATION
❌ Don't ignore employee engagement component (NOC requires it)
❌ Don't give up after one attempt (call if email doesn't get response)
❌ Don't miss relationship-building opportunity even if Feb 2026 doesn't work out

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**Worth pursuing aggressively.** Strong mission alignment (health equity, diversity, NJ community, media recognition) but challenging pathway (no open applications, tight timeline).

**Success depends on:**
1. Making health equity connection explicit
2. Direct outreach to Leslie Hardy
3. Flexibility on support level
4. Long-term relationship mindset

**Even if Feb 2026 doesn't work:** Establishes foundation for 2027 event support or health media partnership programs.

## NEXT STEPS
1. Review full research report for detailed messaging
2. Draft customized email to Leslie Hardy
3. Send email THIS WEEK (Jan 6-12)
