# AstraZeneca Foundation - Sponsorship Research Report
## Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon
**Event Date:** February 26, 2026
**Location:** New Jersey
**Research Date:** January 6, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**FIT ASSESSMENT: MEDIUM-LOW**

While the AstraZeneca Foundation has robust community investment programs focused on health equity and diversity, their current funding mechanisms are **primarily structured around formal grant programs** rather than event sponsorships. The main challenge is that **New Jersey is NOT listed among their eligible geographic footprint** for the 2026 CHANGE grant program, and there appears to be **no clear online submission pathway for one-time event sponsorships** as the user noted.

**However**, there are alternative pathways worth exploring through direct corporate communications channels, given AstraZeneca's strong commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and health equity in underserved communities.

---

## Alignment with ECM Celebration Luncheon

### Strong Alignment Areas (HIGH RELEVANCE):

1. **Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)**
   - AstraZeneca has comprehensive DEI initiatives led by CEO Pascal Soriot
   - Global I&D Council drives accountability across all regions
   - Commitment to workforce representation matching community demographics
   - Active Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) for diverse identities

2. **Health Equity Focus**
   - Core mission area for both Foundation and corporate giving
   - Ethnic and community media plays critical role in health information dissemination to diverse communities
   - Cultural and linguistic appropriateness is explicitly valued in their programs

3. **Community Engagement**
   - "Culturally sensitive, human rights-based approach" is core principle
   - Co-creation with intended beneficiaries
   - Local decision-making and capacity building
   - Trust-building through partnerships

4. **Communications & Media (Potential)**
   - Recognition that reaching diverse communities requires culturally appropriate channels
   - Ethnic media serves populations experiencing health disparities
   - Media as partner in advancing health equity

### Moderate Alignment Areas:

5. **Geographic Connection - New Jersey**
   - AstraZeneca has employees and operations in NJ
   - However, NJ not included in 2026 CHANGE grant eligible states
   - Corporate contributions may have different geographic flexibility

### Weaker Alignment Areas (CHALLENGES):

6. **Event Type**
   - Foundation grants focus on program funding, not one-time events
   - Corporate sponsorships typically for scientific/medical conferences
   - Celebration luncheon is different format than typical sponsorships

7. **Timing**
   - Event date: February 26, 2026
   - CHANGE applications: April 2026 (too late)
   - No clear timeline for corporate sponsorship decisions

---

## Application & Submission Process

### Challenge: No Direct Online Submission for Event Sponsorships

As the user noted, there is **no visible online portal** for submitting event sponsorship requests outside of the formal grant programs. This appears to be intentional - AstraZeneca directs most community support through structured grant cycles.

### Alternative Pathways to Explore:

#### Option 1: Direct Corporate Communications Outreach (RECOMMENDED)
**Contact Information:**
- **US Corporate Contributions:** USContributions@astrazeneca.com
- **Corporate Communications:** corporatecommunications@astrazeneca.com (Canadian office, may redirect)
- **Global Media Relations:** global-mediateam@astrazeneca.com

**Approach:**
- Email inquiry specifically about corporate sponsorship (not Foundation grants)
- Frame as community partnership aligned with DEI and health equity priorities
- Request phone call or meeting to discuss

#### Option 2: Foundation Contact - Exploratory Inquiry
**Contact Information:**
- **Foundation Phone:** 302-886-3000
- **Foundation Email:** connectionsforcardiovascularhealth@astrazeneca.com (program-specific, but may redirect)
- **Medical Education/Grants Office:** grants@astrazeneca.com or 1-877-294-7268
- **Mailing Address:** 1800 Concord Pike, PO Box 14537, Wilmington, DE 19850

**Approach:**
- Acknowledge that event doesn't fit standard grant programs
- Ask if there are alternative funding mechanisms for community events
- Request guidance on appropriate contact for sponsorship inquiries

#### Option 3: New Jersey Local Outreach
**Approach:**
- Identify AstraZeneca NJ office location and local leadership
- Reach out to employee networks or ERGs that might support community events
- Explore local community investment budgets separate from national programs

#### Option 4: Community Solutions Challenge (If Broader Organizational Support)
**If your organization:**
- Runs ongoing programs (not just one-time event)
- Serves communities with health access barriers
- Has 501(c)(3) status and under $12M revenue

**Then consider:**
- Watching for 2026 CSC application window (likely spring/summer)
- Applying for program support that could include event funding as component

## Key Talking Points & Messaging

### Primary Value Proposition:
**"Partner with ethnic and community media to advance health equity in New Jersey's diverse communities"**

### Supporting Talking Points:

1. **Health Equity Alignment:**
   - "Ethnic and community media serve as trusted messengers in communities experiencing health disparities - the exact populations AstraZeneca's ACT on Health Equity initiative aims to reach."
   - "Our media outlets deliver health information in culturally appropriate languages and contexts, addressing the linguistic and cultural barriers your Foundation programs recognize as critical."

2. **DEI Leadership Recognition:**
   - "This celebration honors media outlets that embody AstraZeneca's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by giving voice to underrepresented communities."
   - "By sponsoring this event, AstraZeneca demonstrates support for the infrastructure that makes health equity communication possible."

3. **Community Impact & Reach:**
   - "Ethnic media collectively reach [X number] New Jersey residents who face barriers to healthcare access."
   - "Our outlets serve the racial and ethnic communities that experience the cardiovascular, respiratory, and other health conditions AstraZeneca's Foundation programs target."

4. **New Jersey Connection:**
   - "AstraZeneca's New Jersey employees live and work in the communities our media outlets serve."
   - "This event provides an opportunity to strengthen AstraZeneca's local presence and community relationships in a key operational state."

5. **Beyond One Event - Strategic Partnership:**
   - "This is an entry point for ongoing collaboration where ethnic media can amplify AstraZeneca's health equity messages."
   - "Sponsorship provides visibility with media partners who can help communicate your patient support programs and clinical trial diversity initiatives."

6. **Culturally Sensitive Approach:**
   - "Your Foundation values 'culturally sensitive, human rights-based approaches' - ethnic media ARE this approach in practice."
   - "We facilitate the local decision-making and community engagement your giving principles emphasize."

### Anticipated Objections & Responses:

**Objection:** "We don't fund events, we fund programs."
- **Response:** "We appreciate that distinction. This event celebrates the programs - the ongoing media work that builds health literacy in diverse communities. We're seeking corporate sponsorship recognition of media as health equity infrastructure, not a Foundation grant for a one-time event."

**Objection:** "New Jersey isn't in our current geographic footprint."
- **Response:** "We understand the 2026 CHANGE grants focus on specific states. However, AstraZeneca has employees and operations in New Jersey, and corporate community investment may have different geographic flexibility. We're inquiring whether corporate sponsorships, separate from the Foundation's formal grant programs, might have more inclusive geographic criteria."

**Objection:** "February 26 is too soon / we need more time."
- **Response:** "We understand timing is tight. Even a modest sponsorship level or in-kind support would be meaningful. Alternatively, we'd welcome discussion of AstraZeneca's involvement in future years' events or other partnership opportunities."

**Objection:** "This doesn't fit our health-focused mission."
- **Response:** "Ethnic media IS health infrastructure. Studies show trusted community media significantly impacts health behaviors, screening rates, and care-seeking in diverse populations. The CDC and NIH partner with ethnic media for exactly this reason. We're the communication channel that makes your health equity goals achievable."

## Additional Research Findings

### What AstraZeneca Does NOT Fund:
- Capital campaigns or building projects
- Endowments
- Programs where medical education/training is primary focus (though incidental is OK)
- Political organizations
- Religious organizations (unless serving broader community without religious requirement)
- Individuals
- Events primarily for fundraising purposes

### Reporting Requirements (if formal grant):
- Regular progress reports
- Year-end summaries
- Outcome metrics aligned with stated goals
- Financial accounting

### Timeline Realities:
- Foundation grant decisions: 6+ months from application to award
- Corporate sponsorship decisions: Unclear, likely 4-8 weeks minimum
- Given February 26 event date and current date (January 6), formal grant programs are not viable
- Corporate sponsorship requires rapid decision-making or acceptance of later confirmation

Based on their 2024-2025 recipients and focus areas, they fund:
- Community health centers
- Disease-specific patient advocacy organizations

- LGBTQ+ health organizations
- Programs addressing social determinants of health

### What This Tells Us:
- They value community-based organizations with direct service
- They support communications/education as part of health access
- They fund culturally specific programs
- They're willing to support smaller, local organizations (not just national brands)

## Risk Assessment & Probability of Success

### Factors Supporting Success (Positive):
1. ✅ Strong mission alignment with DEI and health equity
2. ✅ AstraZeneca has NJ presence (local connection)
3. ✅ Ethnic media serves target populations (health disparities)
4. ✅ Multiple contact pathways available
5. ✅ Corporate contributions have more flexibility than Foundation grants

### Factors Working Against Success (Challenges):
1. ❌ No clear online submission process (barrier to entry)
2. ❌ Event format doesn't fit typical grant structure
3. ❌ Tight timeline (7 weeks to event)
4. ❌ NJ not in current CHANGE geographic footprint
5. ❌ No evidence of prior ethnic media event sponsorships
6. ❌ Event is celebratory/recognition vs. direct health service

### Realistic Probability:
- **Foundation Grant (CHANGE, CSC):** 5% - Wrong timing, wrong format, wrong geography
- **Corporate Sponsorship (Small $1-2.5K):** 25% - Possible if reach right contact, frame well
- **Corporate Sponsorship (Medium $5K+):** 15% - Requires strong champion internally
- **Corporate Sponsorship (Large $10K+):** 5% - Unlikely without established relationship
- **In-Kind Support:** 30% - Easier to approve than cash, good entry point

### Recommendation:
**Pursue, but with measured expectations.** This is worth 8-10 hours of effort:
- 2 hours: Research NJ connections, craft compelling email
- 2 hours: Outreach to 3-4 contacts
- 2 hours: Follow-up calls and persistence
- 2-4 hours: Proposal development if interest expressed

**Do NOT spend significant resources** on this as primary funding strategy. Pursue in parallel with higher-probability sponsors.

## Sample Email Template

**Subject:** Community Partnership Inquiry: Ethnic & Community Media Celebration - New Jersey

Dear AstraZeneca Community Investment Team,

I am writing to explore a potential community partnership opportunity that aligns with AstraZeneca's commitment to health equity, diversity, and community engagement.

[Organization Name] is hosting a celebration luncheon on February 26, 2026, in New Jersey to honor ethnic and community media outlets that serve diverse populations experiencing health disparities. These media outlets - representing [X languages/communities] - are trusted messengers that deliver health information in culturally and linguistically appropriate ways to the very communities AstraZeneca's ACT on Health Equity initiative aims to reach.

We recognize this event falls outside your Foundation's formal grant programs, but we believe there is strong alignment with AstraZeneca's corporate values:

- **Health Equity:** Ethnic media serves as critical infrastructure for health communication in communities facing barriers to care
- **Diversity & Inclusion:** This event honors voices that amplify underrepresented communities
- **Community Investment:** AstraZeneca has operations and employees in New Jersey who benefit from strong community media

We are seeking a corporate sponsor to support this event and would welcome a 15-minute conversation to explore whether this partnership opportunity aligns with AstraZeneca's community investment priorities.

I can be reached at [phone] or [email]. Thank you for considering this request, and I look forward to learning more about how we might work together to advance health equity through community media.

Sincerely,
[Name]
[Title]
[Organization]

## Final Recommendation

**PURSUE WITH REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS**

The AstraZeneca Foundation and corporate giving programs demonstrate genuine commitment to health equity, diversity, and community engagement - all areas where ethnic and community media plays a vital role. However, the structural barriers (no NJ in CHANGE footprint, no clear event sponsorship pathway, tight timeline) present significant challenges.

**Best Strategy:**
1. **Primary:** Direct outreach to USContributions@astrazeneca.com with compelling health equity framing
2. **Secondary:** Phone follow-up through 1-800-236-9933 to reach decision-maker
3. **Tertiary:** Long-term relationship building for future opportunities

**Success Metrics:**
- **Ideal:** $2,500-$5,000 cash sponsorship or equivalent in-kind support
- **Good:** $1,000-$2,500 or in-kind materials/support
- **Acceptable:** Establishment of contact for future collaboration, even if 2026 event unsupported
- **Learn & Pivot:** If no response after 3 outreach attempts over 2 weeks, redirect efforts to higher-probability sponsors

**Long-term Value:**
Even if this specific event sponsorship doesn't materialize, AstraZeneca should remain on your radar for:
- Future ECM programs related to health communication
- Partnerships on health equity campaigns
- Community Solutions Challenge grants (if eligible programs)
- CHANGE grants (if they expand to NJ in future years)

The mission alignment is genuinely strong - the challenge is finding the right door to open.
