---

## Priority 4: Do Not Pursue

### 9. Wawa Foundation ⚫ SKIP

**Reason:** Does NOT fund media, journalism, or communications. Only funds Health, Hunger, and Everyday Heroes. User's assessment "doesn't look like we qualify" is 100% accurate.

**Alternative:** Very small corporate sponsorship ($250-$2,500) via LocalMarketing@wawa.com or in-kind pretzels/beverages via local store manager. Low effort only.

---

### 10. Princeton Area Community Foundation ⚫ SKIP

**Reason:** Geographic restrictions exclude organizations not serving Mercer County area. User's assessment "not in their footprint" is accurate and represents a fundamental barrier.

**No alternative pathway viable for Feb 2026 event.**
