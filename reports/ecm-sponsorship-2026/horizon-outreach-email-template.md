**TO:** ulises.diaz@horizonblue.com (confirm format)
**CC:** Foundation_Info@horizonblue.com
**SUBJECT:** Corporate Sponsorship Opportunity: Ethnic & Community Media Celebration (Feb 26)

Dear Mr. Diaz,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to explore a corporate sponsorship opportunity with Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey for an upcoming event that aligns strongly with Horizon's commitment to health equity and diverse communities.

**Event Overview:**
We are hosting an Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026, in New Jersey, bringing together leaders from ethnic media outlets that serve the state's diverse communities—representing the 155+ languages spoken in New Jersey homes that Horizon has so powerfully highlighted in your diversity and inclusion work.

**Why Horizon is the Ideal Partner:**

I recognize that The Horizon Foundation for New Jersey's grant cycle is closed until June 1, and we are specifically seeking a **corporate sponsorship partnership** (separate from the foundation grant process) for this February event.

Our research shows compelling alignment between this event and Horizon's strategic priorities:

1. **Health Equity Mission**: Like Horizon's community health worker model, ethnic media outlets serve as trusted messengers embedded in communities experiencing health disparities.

2. **Multicultural Health Initiatives**: Horizon's $50,000 investment in the "Raices de Buena Salud" documentary with the Latino Leadership Alliance demonstrates recognition of ethnic media's power to address health disparities through storytelling and communication.

3. **Diverse Community Engagement**: Horizon's partnership as presenting sponsor for the Red Bulls' Hispanic Heritage Night and the $100,000 grant for multicultural cardiovascular health initiatives show a commitment to culturally responsive community engagement.

4. **Trusted Communication Channels**: Partnership with ECM provides Horizon direct access to trusted communication channels reaching diverse members and communities.

**Value Proposition:**
This event offers Horizon visibility with and access to the trusted media voices that reach your diverse membership base. It demonstrates authentic commitment to the communities you serve and provides opportunities for future collaboration on health communication initiatives.

**Dual-Track Partnership Opportunity:**
We see this February event as a potential launch point for a longer-term partnership. In addition to corporate sponsorship for the celebration, we are developing a concept for The Horizon Foundation's June 1 grant cycle focused on ethnic media as health equity partners.

**Flexible Partnership Levels:**
We are prepared to customize a sponsorship package based on Horizon's priorities and budget, with options ranging from $5,000 to $25,000, including benefits such as speaking opportunities, exhibit presence, branding, and social media recognition.

**Next Steps:**
Given the February 26 date, we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this partnership by phone at your earliest convenience. I am happy to provide additional information about the event, the ECM organizations involved, and how we can align this opportunity with Horizon's community engagement goals.

Would you be available for a brief call this week or next? Alternatively, please let me know who would be the best contact for corporate sponsorship opportunities.

Thank you for considering this partnership. I look forward to the possibility of working together to celebrate and strengthen the vital role of ethnic media in promoting health equity across New Jersey's diverse communities.

Warm regards,

## EMAIL TEMPLATE 2: To Foundation / Jonathan Pearson

**TO:** Foundation_Info@horizonblue.com
**CC:** [if you have jonathan.pearson@horizonblue.com]
**SUBJECT:** Corporate Sponsorship Inquiry + Future Grant Concept: Ethnic Media & Health Equity

Dear Mr. Pearson and Foundation Team,

I am writing to explore partnership opportunities between Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey and the ethnic and community media organizations serving New Jersey's diverse populations.

**Immediate Opportunity - Corporate Sponsorship (Feb 26, 2026):**

I understand that The Horizon Foundation's grant cycle is closed until June 1. We are seeking a **corporate sponsorship** (separate from foundation grant programs) for our Ethnic and Community Media Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026.

This event brings together leaders from media outlets serving New Jersey's 155+ language communities—the same diverse populations that Horizon is committed to reaching through your health equity initiatives.

**Why This Aligns with Horizon's Mission:**

Your foundation's previous investment in the Latino Leadership Alliance's documentary "Raices de Buena Salud" demonstrates understanding of ethnic media's role in addressing health disparities. We see our event and the broader ECM network as a natural extension of that vision—a collection of trusted messengers who can partner with Horizon to:

- Communicate health information in culturally and linguistically appropriate ways
- Reach communities experiencing health disparities
- Build health literacy in under-resourced populations
- Address social determinants of health through trusted community voices

**Future Opportunity - Foundation Grant (June 1 Cycle):**

Beyond the February event, we are developing a concept paper for submission to The Horizon Foundation's June 1 grant cycle. This program would formalize ethnic media's role as health equity partners, creating measurable outcomes around:

- Health literacy improvement in diverse communities
- Culturally appropriate health communication campaigns
- Community health education through trusted media channels
- Access to health resources and services information

**Dual-Track Approach:**

We envision the February corporate sponsorship as launching a longer-term partnership, with the foundation grant enabling sustained programming. This integrated approach allows Horizon to:

1. **Short-term**: Demonstrate community commitment through event sponsorship
2. **Long-term**: Invest in evidence-based health communication programming
3. **Strategic**: Build infrastructure of trusted health messengers across diverse communities

**Flexible Partnership Options:**

For the February event, we can customize sponsorship benefits ($5,000-$25,000 range) including speaking opportunities, branding, exhibit presence, and social media recognition.

For the June grant application, we are open to consultation on program design to ensure alignment with Horizon Foundation priorities and measurement indicators.

**Request:**

1. **Corporate Sponsorship**: Could you direct me to the appropriate contact for corporate sponsorship opportunities, or would this be handled through your office or Positive Impact?

2. **Foundation Grant Concept**: Would it be appropriate to send a brief concept paper in March for feedback before the June 1 application deadline?

3. **Consultation**: Would you or a Program Officer be available for a brief call to discuss both opportunities?

Given the February 26 event date, I would be grateful for guidance on the corporate sponsorship pathway as soon as possible. For the foundation grant, I am happy to work on your timeline.

Thank you for your consideration and for The Horizon Foundation's remarkable work promoting health equity across New Jersey's diverse communities.
