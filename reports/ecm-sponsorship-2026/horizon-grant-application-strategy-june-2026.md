## Potential Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

### Challenge 1: ECM Organization May Not Have 501(c)(3)

**Mitigation:**
- Identify fiscal sponsor (established nonprofit to receive/administer grant)
- Options: Community foundation, media association, health equity nonprofit
- Establish MOU with fiscal sponsor before concept submission
- Ensure fiscal sponsor has current audit

### Challenge 2: Limited Health-Specific Track Record

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize ECM's community trust and reach (transferable asset)
- Highlight any health content already produced (even informal)
- Partner with health organization for content expertise
- Frame as building on existing strengths with new health focus

### Challenge 3: Evaluation Capacity

**Mitigation:**
- Partner with academic institution or evaluation consultant
- Keep evaluation plan simple but rigorous (surveys, analytics, case studies)
- Budget for evaluation support (7-10% of grant)
- Use free/low-cost tools (Google Forms, social media analytics)

### Challenge 4: Competition

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize unique niche (ethnic media, language access, cultural competency)
- Show non-duplication (not replicating existing health communication efforts)
- Demonstrate cost-effectiveness (leveraging existing media infrastructure)
- Build relationships before application (Feb event, concept consultation)

### Challenge 5: Measuring Health Outcomes

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on awareness and literacy (more measurable short-term)
- Use proxy indicators (information requests, screening participation)
- Survey self-reported behavior change and intent
- Emphasize reach and engagement as interim outcomes
