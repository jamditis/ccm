Hi [Name/Team],

I'm following up on my earlier email about a partnership opportunity for the **Ethnic and Community Media Celebration Luncheon** on **February 26, 2026**.

Given Carlos Medina's work as host of *Que Pasa NJ* and SHCCNJ's commitment to amplifying community voices, this partnership feels like a natural fit.

- **Event:** First-ever gathering of 140+ NJ ethnic and community media outlets
- **Attendees:** Publishers, editors, journalists, lawmakers, ad agencies, communications professionals
- **Direct value for SHCCNJ members:** Access to media outlets for advertising, PR, and business development

The event is similar to how SHCCNJ partnered with Valencia Media Group for the World Cup 2026 event - bringing together media, business, and community impact.

**Would you have 15 minutes this week for a brief call?** I can walk through the partnership levels and how SHCCNJ members could benefit from connecting with ethnic media outlets across New Jersey.

**Subject:** Que Pasa NJ + ECM Luncheon: A Natural Partnership

**Body:**

Hi Carlos,

As the host of *Que Pasa NJ* on PBS, you understand firsthand the power of ethnic media to tell stories that matter to our communities.

I'm reaching out about a partnership opportunity for SHCCNJ with the **Ethnic and Community Media Celebration Luncheon** on **February 26, 2026** - the first event bringing together all 140+ ethnic and community media outlets in New Jersey.

**Why this matters for SHCCNJ:**

Your 7,000 members - representing 120,000 Hispanic-owned businesses - have stories to tell and customers to reach. The media outlets at this luncheon are the ones telling those stories, in Spanish, in Portuguese, in the languages your members' communities speak.

Many of the Latino media outlets attending will be covering the same communities and economic opportunities you're championing - including the World Cup 2026 initiatives SHCCNJ is leading.

**Partnership benefits include:**
- Direct networking for SHCCNJ members with editors and advertising decision-makers
- Speaking opportunity for you to discuss the importance of ethnic media
- Year-long media relationships for coverage of SHCCNJ programs and member successes
- Logo visibility and promotion across 140+ media channels

This isn't just a sponsorship - it's connecting your "familia" with the media voices serving those communities.

**Could we schedule 15 minutes to discuss?** Happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,

P.S. - The Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State is hosting this event, similar to SHCCNJ's successful partnership with NJCU. There's potential for academic collaboration as well.

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out to explore a partnership between SHCCNJ and the **Ethnic and Community Media Celebration Luncheon** on **February 26, 2026**.

I sent an email to chamber@shccnj.org but wanted to follow up directly to ensure this reaches the right person who handles sponsorships and partnerships.

**Brief overview:**
The Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University is hosting the first-ever gathering of New Jersey's 140+ ethnic and community media outlets. We're inviting SHCCNJ to partner because:

1. **Member value:** Direct access to media outlets for SHCCNJ's 7,000 members to explore advertising and PR opportunities

3. **Media experience:** Carlos Medina's work with *Que Pasa NJ* shows SHCCNJ understands ethnic media's impact
4. **Strategic visibility:** Platform with lawmakers, ad agencies, and communications professionals

Similar to SHCCNJ's partnership with Valencia Media Group for the World Cup 2026 event, this is a strategic media relationship, not just transactional sponsorship.
