```
Dear Julie and Zoila,

I'm following up on my earlier message about a partnership opportunity for the Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026.

Given AARP's strong commitment to multicultural outreach - including your sponsorship of NABJ, NAHJ, and AAJA conferences nationally - this event offers a unique state-level opportunity to connect with New Jersey's ethnic media ecosystem.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR AARP:
- 100+ ethnic media outlets serving diverse NJ communities will attend
- These outlets are trusted sources for health, financial, and caregiving information
- Direct access to editors who can amplify AARP's messages to hard-to-reach 50+ populations
- Extends your national ethnic journalism conference partnerships to NJ

SPONSORSHIP LEVELS:
- Community Partner: $2,500 (logo, table for 6, recognition)
- Champion Sponsor: $5,000 (prominent placement, table for 8, speaking opportunity)

Could we schedule a 15-minute call this week to discuss how this partnership could support AARP NJ's multicultural goals?

Thank you for your consideration.

```
Dear Carlos,

I'm following up on my earlier message about a partnership opportunity between SHCCNJ and our Ethnic and Community Media Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026.

As host of "Que Pasa NJ" on PBS, you understand firsthand how ethnic media amplifies community voices. Our event brings together 140+ media outlets doing exactly this work across New Jersey.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR SHCCNJ MEMBERS:
- Your 7,000 members need media access for advertising and PR
- This event puts them in the same room with 140+ publishers, editors, and ad decision-makers
- Similar to your Valencia Media Group partnership, this is a strategic media relationship
- Opportunity for you to address the assembled ethnic media community

PARTNERSHIP OPTIONS:
- Community Partner: $2,500 (logo, table, recognition)
- Champion Sponsor: $5,000 (premier placement, speaking slot, table for 10)
- Co-Promotion Partner: Cross-promote to your member network (flexible)

I'd love to discuss how we can structure a partnership that delivers real value to your members. Could we schedule a brief call?

### 3. African American Chamber Follow-Up

**To:** info@aaccnj.com
**Subject:** Following Up: ECM Celebration - Extending "Black Press on Speed Dial" to All Ethnic Media

```
Dear Dr. Harmon,

I'm following up on my earlier message about a sponsorship opportunity for our Ethnic and Community Media Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026.

Your words resonate deeply with our mission: "No one is going to care about your story and root for your business more than the Black Press. Every member in this organization should have a Black Press outlet on speed dial."

Our event extends that philosophy to the entire ethnic media ecosystem - Black, Latino, Asian American, Middle Eastern, and more - serving diverse communities across New Jersey.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR AACCNJ:
- Connect your 800+ members to 100+ ethnic media outlets beyond Black Press
- Position AACCNJ as a leader building bridges across ALL ethnic communities
- Your members serving Latino customers need Latino media access
- Similar to your Rowan media studio, this strengthens the ethnic media ecosystem

SPONSORSHIP OPTIONS:
- Community Partner: $2,500 (logo, table for 6, recognition)
- Champion Sponsor: $5,000-$10,000 (premier placement, speaking platform, table for 10)
- Co-Promotion: Cross-promote your February Gala and our Luncheon (flexible)

As the only accredited African American Chamber in the entire U.S., your leadership on ethnic media matters. Could we schedule a call to discuss partnership possibilities?

### 4. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield - Corporate Sponsorship

**To:** Foundation_Info@horizonblue.com, info@positiveimpact.net
**Subject:** Corporate Sponsorship Inquiry: Ethnic & Community Media Celebration - Feb 26, 2026

```
Dear Horizon Corporate Sponsorship Team,

I'm reaching out about a corporate sponsorship opportunity for the Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026, hosted by the Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University.

This event celebrates 100+ ethnic and community media outlets serving New Jersey's diverse populations - the same communities Horizon serves across 155+ languages.

WHY HORIZON'S INVOLVEMENT MATTERS:

Horizon's commitment to health equity aligns perfectly with our mission:
- Ethnic media outlets are trusted health messengers in immigrant and minority communities
- Like your investment in "Raices de Buena Salud" documentary, we amplify health equity through community media
- These outlets deliver critical health information in communities facing the greatest disparities

SPONSORSHIP BENEFITS:
- Direct networking with 100+ ethnic media publishers and editors
- Logo visibility on all event materials and promotions
- Speaking opportunity to address assembled media leaders
- Platform to discuss Horizon's health equity initiatives
- Ongoing editorial partnership opportunities with attendees

SPONSORSHIP LEVELS:
- Presenting Sponsor: $15,000-$25,000
- Champion Sponsor: $5,000-$10,000
- Community Partner: $2,500-$5,000

I understand the Horizon Foundation's grant cycle reopens June 1 - we'd also welcome a conversation about that longer-term opportunity. But for the February event, we're seeking corporate sponsorship support.

Could we schedule a brief call to discuss how this partnership serves Horizon's community health mission?

Thank you for your consideration.

### 5. Merck Company Foundation

**To:** leslie_hardy@merck.com
**Subject:** ECM Celebration Partnership - Extending Merck's Health Media Mission to NJ

```
Dear Ms. Hardy,

I'm reaching out about a sponsorship opportunity that aligns with Merck's demonstrated commitment to health media and community impact.

The Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University hosts the annual Ethnic and Community Media Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026 - recognizing 100+ media outlets serving New Jersey's diverse communities.

WHY THIS ALIGNS WITH MERCK'S MISSION:

Merck's international Health Media Training program demonstrates your recognition that journalists drive health behavior change. Our event celebrates journalists doing exactly that work in New Jersey's diverse communities - the same populations experiencing the highest rates of chronic diseases that Merck's programs address.

Since 1957, Merck has called Rahway, New Jersey home. These 100+ ethnic media outlets serve the communities where Merck employees and their families live, work, and seek healthcare information.

PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:
- Presenting Sponsor: $10,000-$25,000 (premier billing, speaking opportunity)
- Champion Sponsor: $5,000 (prominent recognition, table for 8)
- Community Partner: $2,500 (logo placement, event recognition)

I know the Foundation doesn't accept unsolicited proposals through a standard portal, so I'm reaching out directly to explore whether this community-focused opportunity resonates with Merck's mission.

Would you or a colleague be available for a brief call to discuss?

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

### 6. Johnson & Johnson - via Community Foundation of NJ

**To:** mrivera@cfnj.org
**Subject:** J&J Community Support Inquiry - ECM Celebration Luncheon Feb 2026

```
Dear Ms. Rivera,

I'm reaching out to explore potential Johnson & Johnson community support for our Ethnic and Community Media Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026.

The Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University hosts this annual event celebrating 100+ ethnic and community media outlets serving New Jersey's diverse populations.

WHY THIS ALIGNS WITH J&J'S MISSION:

Ethnic media outlets serve as trusted health messengers in the same communities that J&J's health equity initiatives aim to reach. These outlets deliver critical health information in native languages to immigrant and minority populations - often the only source of health news for limited-English-proficiency communities.

Given J&J's New Brunswick headquarters and commitment to New Jersey communities, supporting the media ecosystem that serves diverse NJ residents aligns with both geographic and mission priorities.

REQUEST:
We're seeking $2,500-$10,000 in sponsorship support. Benefits include logo recognition, event attendance, and potential speaking opportunity.

I understand J&J local giving often works through CFNJ channels. Could you advise on the appropriate pathway for this request, or connect me with the right contact?

Thank you for your guidance.

### 7. Campbell's Foundation - In-Kind Request

**To:** Kate_Barrett@campbellsoup.com
**Subject:** In-Kind Partnership Request - ECM Celebration Luncheon Feb 26

```
Dear Ms. Barrett,

I'm reaching out about an in-kind partnership opportunity for the Ethnic and Community Media Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026.

We understand the Campbell's Foundation doesn't fund event sponsorships, so I'm exploring whether in-kind product support might be possible.

THE EVENT:
The Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University hosts this annual celebration of 100+ ethnic and community media outlets serving New Jersey's diverse populations.

IN-KIND REQUEST:
We'd welcome Campbell's product donations to support the luncheon - soups, beverages, or other appropriate items. This would reduce event costs while recognizing Campbell's long commitment to New Jersey communities.

RECOGNITION:
In-kind partners receive logo recognition in event materials, acknowledgment during the program, and social media visibility.

WHY CAMPBELL'S:
Since 1869, Campbell's has called Camden home. Many of the ethnic media outlets at our event serve the diverse South Jersey communities that are Campbell's neighbors.

Would you or a colleague be open to discussing this possibility?

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
