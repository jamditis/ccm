## Why SHCCNJ?

As host of "Que Pasa NJ" on PBS, **Carlos Medina** understands the power of ethnic media to amplify community voices. The ECM Celebration Luncheon brings together 140+ ethnic and community media outlets - many serving the same Hispanic/Latino communities that SHCCNJ's 120,000 member businesses serve.

This partnership aligns perfectly with SHCCNJ's "familia" approach and your proven track record of media partnerships (like Valencia Media Group for World Cup 2026).
