# Johnson & Johnson Foundation Sponsorship Research
## Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon - February 26, 2026

**Research Date:** January 6, 2026
**Event Location:** New Jersey
**Prospect:** Johnson & Johnson Foundation

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Fit Assessment: MEDIUM-LOW**

While Johnson & Johnson Foundation has a strong commitment to health equity and significant community engagement in New Jersey, their funding priorities do not explicitly include journalism or media diversity programs. However, there are strategic alignment opportunities around health equity, community engagement, and diversity/inclusion that could make a case for sponsorship, particularly given J&J's headquarters location in New Brunswick, NJ and their demonstrated support for community events.

**Key Challenge:** The user noted "no way to submit that I see" - this is accurate. J&J has moved to invitation-only models for most local community giving programs in New Jersey.

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR OUTREACH

### Strategy: Multi-Pronged Approach

#### 1. Direct Outreach to Madeline Rivera (IMMEDIATE - DO THIS FIRST)
**Action:** Email inquiry to mrivera@cfnj.org

**Suggested Message Framework:**
```
Subject: Event Sponsorship Inquiry - Ethnic & Community Media Celebration (Feb 26, 2026)

Dear Ms. Rivera,

I am writing to inquire about potential sponsorship opportunities through Johnson & Johnson's community
giving programs for our Ethnic and Community Media (ECM) Celebration Luncheon on February 26, 2026
in New Jersey.

This event celebrates and supports ethnic and community media outlets that serve diverse populations
across New Jersey, including organizations that provide critical health information and resources to
underserved communities in their native languages.

Given Johnson & Johnson's commitment to health equity through initiatives like "My Health Can't Wait"
and your support for community events such as the Sustainable Health & Wellness Village Festival, we
believe there is strong alignment between this event and J&J's mission to close gaps between communities
and the care they need.

Could we schedule a brief conversation to explore whether this aligns with J&J's 2026 community giving
priorities? I would be happy to provide additional information about the event, our participating media
organizations, and the communities they serve.

Thank you for your consideration.
```

#### 2. Research and Identify J&J Corporate Relations/Community Impact Contacts
**Action:** Network through existing connections or LinkedIn to identify:
- J&J Corporate Communications leaders in New Brunswick
- Global Community Impact (GCI) team members
- DEI leadership who manage sponsorship programs
- ERG leaders (particularly those focused on multicultural communities)

#### 3. Emphasize Strategic Alignment Points (See "Talking Points" section below)

#### 4. Consider Alternative Partnerships
If cash sponsorship is not available:
- In-kind support (venue, catering connections, etc.)
- Employee volunteer engagement
- Cross-promotion through J&J's community channels
- Connection to J&J's diverse supplier program

## ASSESSMENT OF FIT FOR ECM EVENT

### Overall Rating: MEDIUM-LOW (60/100)

### Strengths (Why This Could Work):
✅ **Health Equity Mission Alignment (Strong)**
- Ethnic and community media outlets often serve as trusted health information sources for immigrant and minority communities
- ECM outlets distribute health information in native languages to underserved populations
- Aligns with J&J's "My Health Can't Wait" initiative targeting communities of color

✅ **Geographic Alignment (Strong)**
- Event in New Jersey where J&J is headquartered
- J&J has demonstrated commitment to NJ community events
- Proven track record of sponsoring community gatherings in the state

✅ **Diversity & Inclusion Alignment (Strong)**
- J&J's commitment to diverse talent and multicultural initiatives
- Founding member of Unstereotype Alliance (addressing media representation)
- 12 ERGs focused on diverse communities

✅ **Community Engagement Track Record (Strong)**
- J&J sponsors similar community events (SHWV Festival)
- Strong partnerships with community organizations
- Supports grassroots, community-led initiatives

### Challenges (Why This Is Difficult):
❌ **No Media/Journalism Funding Program (Critical)**
- J&J Foundation does not have explicit journalism or media diversity funding programs
- Primary focus is healthcare, not communications/media sector
- No evidence of previous journalism/media sponsorships

❌ **Invitation-Only Model (Critical)**
- Most local NJ community giving is now invitation-only
- Limited open application pathways
- User already noted "no way to submit"

❌ **Timing Constraints (Moderate)**
- Event is Feb 26, 2026 (less than 2 months away)
- J&J requires 60 days advance notice for event support
- Quarterly funding decisions may not align with event timeline
- Next CFNJ funding decision: end of January 2026 (cutting it close)

❌ **Misalignment with Core Programs (Moderate)**
- Foundation focuses on healthcare workforce, nursing, community health workers
- Event is not directly health-focused
- Would need to make indirect case for health information dissemination role of ethnic media

### Probability of Success: 25-35%
This would be an "outside the box" sponsorship for J&J Foundation. Success would depend on:
1. Finding a champion within J&J who sees the strategic value
2. Framing the ask around health equity and health communication
3. Timing alignment with funding cycles
4. Personal connections or warm introductions

## SPECIFIC TALKING POINTS ALIGNED WITH J&J MISSION

### Primary Frame: Ethnic Media as Health Equity Partners

**1. Health Information Access for Underserved Communities**
> "Ethnic and community media outlets serve as the primary source of health information for immigrant and
> minority communities across New Jersey. These trusted media sources deliver critical health messages in
> native languages, helping close the information gap that contributes to health inequities—directly
> supporting Johnson & Johnson's mission to create a world without health inequities."

**Key Data Points to Include (if available):**
- Number of people reached by ECM outlets in NJ
- Languages served
- Health-related coverage examples
- Geographic overlap with J&J's target communities (Somerset, Hunterdon, Middlesex Counties)

**2. Amplifying "My Health Can't Wait" Message**
> "This event brings together media outlets that reach the very communities J&J's 'My Health Can't Wait'
> initiative serves—Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian American, and immigrant populations. By supporting ethnic
> media, J&J invests in the communication infrastructure that extends the reach of critical health
> messages to communities of color."

**3. Diversity in Media = Diversity in Health Narratives**
> "Just as Johnson & Johnson has recognized the importance of diversity in healthcare innovation through
> initiatives like the Diversity in Innovation QuickFire Challenge, diverse media voices are essential for
> culturally competent health communication. Supporting ethnic media strengthens the ecosystem that makes
> health information accessible and relevant to diverse communities."

**4. Community-Led Solutions**
> "Johnson & Johnson Foundation champions 'community-led initiatives'—ethnic and community media outlets
> ARE community-led initiatives. These organizations are founded, operated, and trusted by the very
> communities J&J seeks to serve, making them authentic partners in advancing health equity."

**5. New Jersey Impact**
> "This event celebrates media organizations serving New Jersey's diverse communities—the same communities
> surrounding J&J's New Brunswick headquarters. Supporting this event demonstrates J&J's commitment to the
> neighbors and communities that have been home to the company for over 130 years."

**6. Addressing Representation and Stereotypes**
> "As a founding member of the UN Women Unstereotype Alliance, J&J recognizes that media representation
> matters. Ethnic and community media outlets provide authentic representation and counter stereotypes by
> telling community stories from within, not from the outside looking in."

**7. Building Trust Through Trusted Messengers**
> "During the COVID-19 pandemic, ethnic media proved essential in delivering accurate health information to
> communities experiencing disproportionate health impacts. Investing in these trusted messengers is investing
> in the infrastructure needed to address future health challenges and reach communities that traditional
> media often overlooks."

### Secondary Frame: Economic Empowerment and Supplier Diversity

**8. Supporting Diverse Business Ecosystem**
> "Johnson & Johnson invests $1 billion annually in women and minority-owned businesses. Many ethnic media
> outlets are exactly that—minority-owned small businesses that serve as economic anchors in their
> communities while addressing information equity."

## ALTERNATIVE ANGLES IF DIRECT SPONSORSHIP DOESN'T WORK

### 1. Partnership Instead of Sponsorship
Rather than asking for event sponsorship, propose an ongoing partnership where:
- ECM outlets become distribution partners for J&J health equity initiatives
- J&J provides health content/expertise; ECM provides culturally competent distribution
- Pilot program to measure reach and impact in specific NJ communities

### 2. Connection to Existing J&J Programs
- Invite J&J to present at the luncheon about "My Health Can't Wait" initiative
- Feature J&J's health equity work in ECM outlets post-event
- Create a "Health Equity in Media" award sponsored by J&J

### 3. Employee Engagement Opportunity
- Invite J&J ERG members to attend the luncheon
- Create volunteer opportunities for J&J employees with ECM outlets
- Align with J&J's 20,000+ ERG members' engagement goals

### 4. In-Kind Support
If cash sponsorship isn't available:
- Venue support (J&J facilities or connections)
- Catering connections
- Marketing/communications support
- Expertise sharing (DEI best practices, health communication)

## NEXT STEPS AND TIMELINE

### Immediate Actions (This Week):
1. ✅ Email Madeline Rivera at mrivera@cfnj.org with event inquiry
2. ✅ Research J&J Global Community Impact team on LinkedIn
3. ✅ Prepare one-page event overview highlighting health equity connections
4. ✅ Identify any existing connections to J&J employees (board members, attendees, etc.)

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks):
5. Follow up with Madeline Rivera if no response within 5 business days
6. Attempt to identify alternative J&J contacts in Corporate Communications or DEI
7. Research if any ECM outlets have existing relationships with J&J
8. Prepare backup sponsorship prospects in case J&J declines

### Realistic Expectations:
- Given the Feb 26, 2026 timeline, this is a challenging timeline for J&J's processes
- Even with the 60-day advance notice met, invitation-only model presents barriers
- May be more successful for 2027 event if relationships can be built now
- Consider J&J for other ECM initiatives beyond just the luncheon

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Proceed with cautious optimism, but pursue multiple prospects simultaneously.**

Johnson & Johnson Foundation is worth pursuing due to:
- Strong geographic alignment (NJ headquarters)
- Health equity mission that can be connected to ethnic media's role
- Demonstrated history of community event sponsorship in NJ
- DEI commitments that align with ECM's diversity mission

However, significant barriers exist:
- No journalism/media funding program
- Invitation-only model
- Tight timeline for Feb 26, 2026 event
- Need to make indirect case for alignment

**Primary action:** Contact Madeline Rivera immediately with a well-crafted pitch emphasizing health equity angles.

**Backup plan:** Have 2-3 alternative sponsors researched and ready to pursue if J&J declines or cannot respond in time.

**Long-term relationship:** Even if sponsorship doesn't materialize for 2026, use this as an opportunity to build relationships for future collaborations. J&J may be interested in ongoing partnerships with ethnic media for health communication rather than one-time event sponsorship.
