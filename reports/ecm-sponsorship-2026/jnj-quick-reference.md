## ECM Luncheon Sponsorship Prospect

**Date:** January 6, 2026 | **Event:** Feb 26, 2026 | **Fit:** MEDIUM-LOW (60/100)

## 🎯 KEY TAKEAWAY
J&J doesn't have a media/journalism funding program, but they DO sponsor NJ community events focused on health equity and diversity. The connection needs to be made through ethnic media's role in health information dissemination to underserved communities.

## ✅ STRONGEST ALIGNMENT POINTS

1. **Health Equity Mission** - J&J committed $100M to eliminate health inequities for communities of color. Ethnic media delivers health info to these exact communities.

2. **"My Health Can't Wait" Initiative** - Reached 100,000+ people in communities of color. ECM outlets are trusted health info sources for these populations.

3. **NJ Community Events** - J&J sponsors Sustainable Health & Wellness Village Festival in NJ (presenting sponsor). Proven track record of community event support.

4. **DEI Commitment** - Founding member of UN Women Unstereotype Alliance (media representation), 12 ERGs, $1B annually to diverse businesses.

5. **Geographic Home** - HQ in New Brunswick, NJ. Strong commitment to Somerset, Hunterdon, Middlesex counties.

---

## ⚠️ MAJOR CHALLENGES

1. **No Media Funding Program** - Focus is healthcare, nursing, community health workers—NOT journalism/media.

2. **Invitation-Only** - Most NJ community giving is now invitation-only. Limited open applications.

3. **Tight Timeline** - Event is Feb 26 (< 2 months). J&J requires 60 days notice. Next funding decision: end of January.

4. **Indirect Fit** - Need to make case that ethnic media = health equity infrastructure.

## 💬 30-SECOND PITCH

"Ethnic and community media outlets serve as the primary source of health information for immigrant and minority communities across New Jersey—the same communities J&J's 'My Health Can't Wait' initiative serves. These trusted media sources deliver critical health messages in native languages, helping close the information gap that contributes to health inequities. Supporting this celebration luncheon invests in the communication infrastructure that extends J&J's health equity mission to underserved populations."

This is an "outside the box" ask for J&J. Success requires:
