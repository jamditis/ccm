# Changelog: AI support for local news organizations concept paper

Document: `2026-2028 AI support for local news organizations.md`
Date: December 11, 2025

---

## Summary

This document was expanded from a partial draft to a complete funding pitch. The original had placeholder text ("XXXXX") in three sections. All placeholders have been replaced with substantive content, hyperlinks added, two reference sections appended, and five strategic sections added to address common funder questions (target audience, urgency, metrics, growth, sustainability).

---

## Changes by section

### Introduction (lines 6-9)

**Original:**
> "The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing every aspect of the media industry and presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for local news providers."

**Revised:**
> "The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is changing how news is produced, distributed, and consumed. Local news providers face specific challenges: they need to do more with less, compete with larger outlets that have dedicated AI teams, and navigate a landscape where new tools emerge weekly."

**Rationale:** Removed "fundamentally" (filler intensifier), "every aspect" (hyperbolic), and "unique set of challenges and opportunities" (cliché). Replaced with specific, concrete challenges.

---

### Problem and solution (line 16)

**Original:**
> "This AI help desk program would be run by the Center for Cooperative Media's Joe Amditis, a leading voice at the intersection of artificial intelligence and journalism. His contributions span education, research, and practical implementation of AI technologies in newsrooms."

**Revised:**
> "This AI help desk program would be run by the Center for Cooperative Media's Joe Amditis, who has spent the past three years building AI tools and training resources specifically for local newsrooms. He has developed interactive tools that help journalists choose the right AI models for their projects, created template libraries for AI-assisted development, and built production applications for news organizations across New Jersey."

**Rationale:** Replaced vague praise ("leading voice at the intersection") with specific evidence of work done.

---

### How it would work (lines 18-34)

**Original:**
```
XXXXX
I am thinking you do:
-Weekly newsletter on new stuff
-Webinars once a month
-Open building hours once a month
-Intake desk where people request help

Do we call it an AI help desk?
```

**Replaced with:** Full descriptions of all four program components:

1. **Weekly newsletter** — Curated email on AI developments, explaining what's useful vs. hype, with links to resources and case studies.

2. **Monthly webinars** — Live demos with Q&A, covering practical workflows and strategic decisions. Recorded for on-demand access.

3. **Monthly open building hours** — Drop-in virtual sessions for hands-on project help and peer learning.

4. **Help desk intake system** — Asynchronous support with 48-72 hour response time, escalation path for complex projects.

5. **Example scenario** — Added concrete example of a two-person newsroom seeking help with Spanish-language newsletter translation.
