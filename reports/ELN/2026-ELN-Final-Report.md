## THEMATIC ANALYSIS

### Strongest Coverage Areas in 2025

1. **Immigration Enforcement** - Multiple outlets provided essential coverage of ICE activity, community fear, municipal responses, and Mayor Baraka's resistance

2. **School Financial Accountability** - Montclair Local's sustained investigation is a model; Chalkbeat's Newark coverage also excellent

3. **Environmental Contamination** - PFAS, legacy pollution (Pfizer, DuPont), climate impacts (LBI flooding) well-documented

4. **Local Government Transparency** - OPRA violations, public records access battles, prosecutorial dysfunction

5. **Institutional Abuse Cover-ups** - Delbarton trial, teacher abuse patterns, Newark school racism

### Coverage Gaps Identified

| Gap Area | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Criminal Justice Reform | Limited court coverage beyond high-profile cases |

| Housing/Homelessness | Covered but fewer sustained investigations |
| Labor Issues | Underreported wage theft, workplace safety |
| Rural NJ | Most coverage concentrated in North/Central Jersey |

## SYSTEMIC FINDINGS

### Ethnic Media Submission Gap

A significant finding: several outstanding ethnic media outlets submitted zero or minimal stories:

| Outlet | Submissions | Context |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Atlantic City Focus | 0 | 2025 Champion Award winner |
| Black in Jersey | 0 | 2023 Partner of the Year |
| Central Desi | 0 | $100K grant recipient |
| Front Runner NJ | 1 | Only Black media in South Jersey |
| Echo Press | 50+ | Technical access initially blocked evaluation |

**Recommendation:** Proactive outreach to ethnic media for supplemental submissions and adjusted evaluation criteria to address systematic disadvantage.

### Outlets Under-Submitting Their Best Work

Several outlets' strongest journalism was NOT in the CSV submissions:

- **NJ Monitor** - Only 1 story submitted despite multiple major investigations
- **Chalkbeat Newark** - Only 3 stories submitted; racism/AI camera investigations not included
- **Delaware Currents** - 9 stories submitted but deserves more recognition

**Recommendation:** Consider supplemental submission process or proactive identification of strong work from partner outlets.

## CONCLUSION

The 2025 story submissions demonstrate the strength and diversity of New Jersey's local news ecosystem. From HudPost's corruption investigations to Echo Press's courageous ethnic media coverage to Montclair Local's sustained accountability journalism, these outlets are producing work that serves their communities and holds power accountable.

The strongest submissions share common characteristics:
- **Document-driven reporting** - obtaining records officials wanted hidden
- **Sustained attention** - following stories over months, not just breaking news
- **Community voice** - centering those most affected by the issues covered
- **Accountability outcomes** - coverage that leads to investigations, policy changes, or resignations

We recommend the awards committee prioritize the Tier 1 stories identified in this report while also addressing the systemic gaps in ethnic media representation and creating recognition for sustained coverage series.
