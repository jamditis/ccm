# Campus/Student Media Analysis for 2026 ELN Awards
## Story Submissions - Wrapped 2025 Analysis

**Analysis Date:** January 6, 2026
**Dataset:** /home/user/ccm/reports/ELN/Story Submissions-Wrapped 2025.csv
**Total Submissions:** 1,473 stories

---

## CRITICAL FINDING: Zero Campus Media Submissions

After comprehensive analysis of all 1,473 submissions in the Wrapped 2025 dataset, **NO campus or student media publications submitted stories**, despite being explicitly eligible for ELN awards.

### Search Methodology

Multiple search strategies were employed to identify campus media:

1. **Direct searches for known NJ student publications:**
   - The Montclarion (Montclair State University)
   - The Setonian (Seton Hall University)
   - Daily Princetonian (Princeton University)
   - Eastside (Cherry Hill East High School)
   - The Whit (Rowan University)
   - The Gothic Times (New Jersey City University)
   - **Result:** ZERO submissions found

2. **Domain searches:**
   - .edu domains (found only official university PR sites, not student newspapers)
   - Student publication URL patterns
   - **Result:** No student newspaper domains

3. **Source field analysis:**
   - Reviewed all 95 unique sources in the dataset
   - Identified three publications initially flagged for investigation:
     - Ridge View Echo - **CONFIRMED: Professional nonprofit local news (Warren County)**
     - Woodbury Warbler - **CONFIRMED: Independent community newsletter, not student media**
     - The Retrospect - **CONFIRMED: Professional weekly newspaper since 1902**
   - **Result:** Zero verified student publications

4. **Content searches:**
   - Terms: "student reporter," "student journalist," "intern," "campus newspaper," "school newspaper"
   - **Result:** Only found stories ABOUT students, not BY student journalists

### Why This Matters

#### 1. **Eligibility Confirmed**
Per the ELN Awards eligibility requirements:
- "Student/intern work is eligible if published by a New Jersey news and information provider"
- Campus media organizations can be NJ News Commons members

#### 2. **Historical Precedent**
Campus media has won ELN awards before:
- **2025:** The Setonian won NJ Journalism Impact Award for sexual abuse investigation
- **2021:** The Gothic Times (NJCU) won Outstanding Campus Media
- **2020:** The Whit (Rowan) won Outstanding Campus Media

#### 3. **Known Quality Campus Journalism in NJ**

From the research document, notable 2025 campus journalism includes:

| Publication | School | Notable 2025 Work |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **The Setonian** | Seton Hall University | Sexual abuse investigation (8 articles) by Sofia Kasbo - won 2025 Impact Award for "courage and integrity" |
| **Daily Princetonian** | Princeton University | Pro-Palestine discipline investigation exposing "invasive" university investigation tactics |
| **The Montclarion** | Montclair State | Hazing & discrimination lawsuits investigations |
| **Eastside** | Cherry Hill East HS | Bomb threat evacuation coverage by Claire Ding (GSSPA All-Star) - #1 NJ high school paper for 16 consecutive years |

### Gap Analysis

**What's Missing:** Despite being home to the Center for Cooperative Media (at Montclair State University), the Wrapped 2025 collection contains:
- ✅ 95 professional news outlets
- ✅ Ethnic and community media
- ✅ Hyperlocal watchdog journalism
- ✅ Major investigations from NJ Monitor, Jersey Vindicator, Chalkbeat Newark
- ❌ **ZERO student newspaper submissions**

### Implications

1. **Incomplete Picture:** Campus journalism covering university accountability, student issues, and campus community impact is entirely absent from consideration
2. **Missed Award Opportunities:** Student journalists who may have produced award-worthy work in 2025 are not represented
3. **Network Gap:** Student publications may not be aware of or engaged with NJ News Commons membership benefits

## Recommendation: Proactive Outreach Required

Since the Wrapped 2025 collection contains no campus media submissions, the following actions are recommended:

### Option 1: Direct Outreach to Known Publications
Contact these proven NJ student newsrooms directly:
1. **The Setonian** (Seton Hall) - 2025 Impact Award winner
2. **The Montclarion** (Montclair State) - located at CCM host institution
3. **Daily Princetonian** (Princeton)
4. **Eastside** (Cherry Hill East HS) - #1 NJ high school paper
5. **The Whit** (Rowan) - 2020 award winner
6. **The Gothic Times** (NJCU) - 2021 award winner

### Option 2: Review 2025 Work Independently
Research and evaluate notable 2025 campus journalism independently, including:
- The Setonian's award-winning sexual abuse investigation
- Daily Princetonian's discipline investigation
- The Montclarion's hazing/discrimination coverage
- Eastside's real-time bomb threat coverage

### Option 3: Campus Media Outreach Initiative
Create a targeted campus media engagement program for 2026 to ensure future participation:
- Partner with student journalism associations
- Present at college media conferences
- Offer student-specific submission guidance
- Consider a dedicated "Outstanding Campus Media" recognition category

## Related: Montclair Coverage in Dataset

While The Montclarion (student newspaper) is absent, **Montclair Local** (professional hyperlocal outlet) submitted significant education watchdog journalism:

### Notable Montclair Local Education Stories (2025)

| Story | Date | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Montclair schools withhold budget doc in pattern of OPRA denials** | 4/16/2025 | Government transparency investigation |
| **Past due bills a 'disconcerting' pattern in Montclair schools, leaked docs show** | 3/17/2025 | Financial accountability using leaked documents |
| **Montclair school officials probe how millions in unpaid bills piled up** | 4/28/2025 | Follow-up investigation |
| **Montclair public schools reveal $11 million deficit** | 7/31/2025 | Major financial crisis uncovered |
| **Judge orders Montclair schools to produce docs detailing discrimination claims** | 8/27/2025 | Civil rights/legal accountability |
| **Montclair school deficit rises to nearly $18m, district says** | 9/15/2025 | Ongoing crisis coverage |
| **Everything we know now about Montclair schools' massive deficit** | 10/13/2025 | Comprehensive investigation |
| **Former Montclair school official's action cost district over $500K, claim says** | 11/20/2025 | Accountability journalism |

**Pattern:** Sustained, documents-driven accountability journalism on Montclair Public Schools fiscal crisis throughout 2025.

**Note:** These are professional journalism investigations, but highlight the type of educational accountability work that campus media at Montclair State could also be covering regarding their own institution.

## Conclusion

**The limitation is confirmed and significant:** Campus/student media was completely absent from the Wrapped 2025 submissions despite:
- Clear eligibility
- Historical award wins
- Known high-quality work in 2025
- Geographic proximity to the Center for Cooperative Media

**Recommendation:** Given zero campus media submissions in the current dataset, evaluating campus journalism for 2026 ELN Awards will require proactive outreach and independent research rather than relying on the Wrapped collection.
