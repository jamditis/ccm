## TOP 5 ETHNIC & COMMUNITY MEDIA STORIES

### #1: Hispanic Businesses and State Economy at Risk Due to Trump's Immigration Policies

**Outlet:** Reporte Hispano (Spanish-language)
**Date:** September 30, 2025
**URL:** https://reportehispano.com/2025/09/hispanic-businesses-and-state-economy-at-risk-due-to-trumps-immigration-policies/

#### Community/Cultural Angle
This investigative piece centers the Latino business community in New Jersey, examining how Trump administration immigration policies have devastated Hispanic-owned businesses. The reporting connects individual merchant struggles on Monroe Street to broader economic implications affecting the entire state economy. The story elevates voices often marginalized in mainstream economic reporting—immigrant business owners, workers facing wage theft, and Spanish-speaking consumers.

#### Journalistic Quality: **9/10**

**Strengths:**
- **Strong sourcing:** Combines ground-level testimony with institutional data from UCLA, New Jersey Policy Perspective, and Pew Research Center
- **Concrete impact data:** Documents 80% sales drops, quantifies Latino GDP contribution ($194 billion in NJ; $4.1 trillion nationally)
- **Multiple stakeholder voices:** Individual merchants (Suceli Salazar), labor organizations (Gloria Guerrero Romero from New Labor), business chambers, and workers
- **Sector-specific analysis:** Breaks down immigrant labor percentages across industries (48% kitchen staff, 36% construction)
- **Legal context:** Includes Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent on targeting Latino workers

**Key Quote:**
"Trump's immigration policies have severely affected my business. My sales have dropped by 80%" — Suceli Salazar

"All Latinos...who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time." — Justice Sonia Sotomayor

#### Why It Deserves Award Consideration

This story exemplifies ethnic media at its best: serving as the primary journalistic voice for an underrepresented community while producing rigorous, data-driven reporting that rivals any mainstream outlet. Reporte Hispano provides essential coverage that Spanish-speaking readers cannot find elsewhere, combining microeconomic storytelling (individual business struggles) with macroeconomic analysis (state GDP impact).

The reporting reveals an underreported consequence of immigration enforcement: employer exploitation and wage theft enabled by workers' fear of deportation. By documenting specific ICE raids in Edison and Princeton, the story grounds abstract policy debates in concrete New Jersey impacts.

**Community Impact:** High — Directly serves the state's 475,000 undocumented residents and broader Latino business community with actionable information about economic risks and labor rights.

### #2: 'There Has to Be More' — Civil Rights Activist Lawrence Hamm on Political Awakening

**Outlet:** Montclair Local
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**URL:** https://montclairlocal.news/2025/05/there-has-to-be-more-civil-rights-activist-lawrence-hamm-says-on-political-awakening-fight/

#### Community/Cultural Angle
This deeply reported profile chronicles Lawrence Hamm, 71-year-old chairman of People's Organization for Progress, tracing five decades of Black activism from the 1967 Newark uprising through contemporary resistance to Trump administration policies. The piece connects historical civil rights struggles to current fights against gentrification, immigration enforcement, and police violence, demonstrating intergenerational continuity in Black liberation movements.

#### Journalistic Quality: **9/10**

**Strengths:**
- **Narrative depth:** Moves beyond surface-level activist profile to explore psychological formation through childhood trauma (National Guard occupation, door-to-door searches)
- **Historical context:** Connects 1967 Newark rebellion, 1970 teacher strikes, and 2025 ICE resistance within a coherent activist lineage
- **Balanced reporting:** Acknowledges complications (police sanctions, arrests) without diminishing Hamm's contributions
- **Local grounding:** Examines 35-year Montclair residence to discuss gentrification's impact on Black communities
- **Direct observation:** Reporter attended April 4 Newark memorial, providing firsthand context

**Key Quotes:**
"There has to be more. It has to be consistent. It has to be protracted. We have to use all the weapons in our arsenal."

"Protests draw attention to problems" — explaining tactical philosophy

#### Why It Deserves Award Consideration

Reporter Matt Kadosh delivers a masterclass in activist profiling, humanizing Hamm through specific childhood memories rather than treating him as a symbolic figure. The article serves Black readers by documenting community history often erased from mainstream narratives while offering younger activists a roadmap for sustained organizing.

The piece avoids hagiography by presenting activism's costs alongside its achievements, creating authentic representation rather than mythology. By centering a Black leader's 50+ year commitment to justice, the story demonstrates how ethnic/community media preserves essential historical knowledge and connects past struggles to present movements.

**Community Impact:** High — Provides Black communities with documented history of local organizing, offers strategic lessons for current activists, and preserves institutional memory.

### #3: ACLU–NJ's Director Talks Trump, ICE and Montclair

**Outlet:** Montclair Local
**Date:** February 10, 2025
**URL:** https://montclairlocal.news/2025/02/aclu-njs-director-talks-trump-ice-and-montclair/

#### Community/Cultural Angle
This interview with Amol Sinha, ACLU-NJ Executive Director and child of Indian immigrants, examines the organization's response to Trump's immigration enforcement escalation. The story centers immigrant community fears following Newark's Ironbound neighborhood ICE raid, providing practical "Know Your Rights" guidance alongside policy analysis.

#### Journalistic Quality: **8.5/10**

**Strengths:**
- **Personal narrative:** Explores how childhood experiences with microaggressions shaped Sinha's career, connecting individual to systemic
- **Verified claims:** Documents 400 prior lawsuits against Trump administration, includes ICE arrest statistics
- **Multiple perspectives:** ACLU leadership, DHS counterarguments, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, state AG Matthew Platkin
- **Actionable information:** Provides specific guidance for immigrants encountering federal agents
- **Constitutional analysis:** Explains birthright citizenship's connection to addressing slavery's harms

**Key Quotes:**
"What we have right now is a sense of fear and panic in immigrant communities."

"The second Trump administration has come in and they are smarter...determined to do more harm than ever before."

On birthright citizenship: "It is one of the ways in which the United States addressed one of the terrible harms of slavery."

#### Why It Deserves Award Consideration

This piece excels at bridging advocacy and journalism, providing immigrant communities with essential legal information while maintaining rigorous reporting standards. The personal narrative angle humanizes abstract policy debates, helping readers understand how systemic inequality shapes individual lives.

By centering an Indian-American civil rights leader, the story represents Asian immigrant perspectives often absent from immigration coverage. The practical "Know Your Rights" component offers vulnerable readers actionable protection rather than solely reporting on their endangerment.

**Community Impact:** Very High — Directly serves immigrant communities with legal guidance during heightened enforcement, contextualizes rights violations within constitutional framework.

### #4: Morristown Council Backs Bill to Protect Undocumented Immigrants Facing Deportation

**Outlet:** Morristown Green
**Date:** January 30, 2025
**URL:** https://morristowngreen.com/2025/01/30/applause-anxiety-and-an-apology-immigration-vote-stirs-emotions-in-morristown/

#### Community/Cultural Angle
This meeting coverage captures Morristown's city council unanimously endorsing the state Immigrant Trust Act, featuring direct testimony from undocumented residents Maria and Freddy. The story documents both community solidarity and internal tensions within immigrant advocacy coalitions, revealing complexity beyond simplistic narratives.

#### Journalistic Quality: **8/10**

**Strengths:**
- **Direct immigrant voices:** Maria's testimony about children "terrorized" by ICE threat provides emotional grounding
- **Municipal process detail:** Documents procedural friction over speaking time rules for interpreted testimony
- **Regional context:** Cites specific ICE raids in Newark, Paterson, and other NJ municipalities
- **Historical precedent:** Traces Morristown's 2007 deputization controversy and 2017 sanctuary designation
- **Internal complexity:** Captures Vice President Silva's public apology regarding confrontational advocacy tactics

**Key Quotes:**
"Children born here to immigrant families are terrorized because any moment, ICE will rip them apart." — Maria

"By law, interpreters are entitled to the same microphone time afforded to speakers." — Attorney Karol Ruiz

"Common sense is that we have many families, hard-working families...contributing, not only to the community, but to the nation." — Vice President David Silva

#### Why It Deserves Award Consideration

This story excels at representing immigrant community voices directly rather than through intermediaries, giving undocumented residents Maria and Freddy platforms to share personal experiences. The reporting demonstrates cultural competency by acknowledging interpretation time requirements and documenting procedural barriers faced by non-English speakers.

The standout element is capturing internal community friction—Silva apologizing for Ruiz's approach—revealing coalition tensions mainstream coverage typically obscures. This nuanced representation serves readers better than presenting monolithic "immigrant community" perspectives.

**Community Impact:** High — Informs immigrant residents about local protections, documents their advocacy in public record, demonstrates municipal support during federal crackdown.

### #5: HIAS Honors Cherry Hill Synagogue for Refugee Relief Work

#### Why It Deserves Award Consideration

This story represents an underreported angle in immigration coverage: faith-based community responses and cross-cultural solidarity. By centering a Jewish congregation supporting Muslim, Hindu, African, and Latin American refugees, the piece demonstrates how religious communities bridge cultural divides.

The reporting connects local grassroots action to global humanitarian frameworks, helping readers understand how individual congregations contribute to addressing worldwide displacement. While lacking direct refugee voices (a weakness), the story effectively documents institutional infrastructure supporting vulnerable populations.

**Community Impact:** Moderate-High — Highlights model for faith-based refugee support, documents Jewish community values in action, may inspire similar efforts in other congregations.

## HONORABLE MENTIONS

### ICE Raid at North Bergen Warehouse Leads to Multiple Detentions
**Outlet:** HudPost
**Date:** February 27, 2025
**Quality:** 7/10

Strong breaking news coverage of ICE raid at STG Logistics, providing regulatory context explaining federal jurisdiction over customs facilities. Demonstrates attempt to obtain official comment despite ICE confidentiality constraints. Weakness: lacks direct interviews with affected workers or community organizations.

---

## EVALUATION SUMMARY

### Overall Assessment

This year's ethnic and community media submissions demonstrate exceptional journalism serving New Jersey's underrepresented communities. The top stories share several strengths:

1. **Authentic Community Representation:** Direct quotes from community members rather than exclusively institutional spokespeople
2. **Cultural Competency:** Understanding of interpretation needs, immigration law complexities, and historical context
3. **Rigorous Sourcing:** Combination of ground-level testimony and institutional data
4. **Underreported Issues:** Coverage of topics mainstream media often overlooks (wage theft, faith-based refugee support, activist history)
5. **Community Service:** Providing actionable information (legal rights, economic analysis) alongside reporting

### Standout Outlet: Reporte Hispano

The Spanish-language outlet's economic impact investigation represents ethnic media's essential role: serving communities mainstream outlets underserve while maintaining rigorous journalistic standards. The story would be strong in any outlet but gains additional significance as coverage specifically for and about the Latino community.

### Recommendation

All five stories merit serious award consideration. If forced to choose a single winner, **Reporte Hispano's "Hispanic businesses and state economy at risk"** edges ahead due to:
- Representing true ethnic media (Spanish-language serving Latino community)
- Exceptional data journalism combined with human storytelling
- Revealing underreported consequences (employer exploitation during enforcement)
- Direct community service with economic analysis affecting 475,000+ residents
