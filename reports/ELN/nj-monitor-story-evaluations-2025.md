**Reporter:** Dana DiFilippo, Senior Reporter
**Publication Date:** December 10, 2025
**URL:** https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/12/10/south-jersey-nursing-homes-fraud/

### Summary
State comptroller investigation uncovered a massive $100+ million Medicaid fraud scheme involving two South Jersey nursing homes (Hammonton and Deptford). Owners David Hagler and Chaim Rozenberg operated a complex fraud network spanning 46 nursing homes across NJ, NY, Kansas, and Missouri.

### Investigative Quality: EXCELLENT (9/10)

**Strengths:**

- **Complex financial forensics**: Documented improper real estate deals, excessive loans, inflated rents, and undisclosed fees to 9 related entities
- **Detailed financial analysis**: Tracked $134.8M in Medicaid funds (2019-mid 2024), of which $92M was illegally funneled to related businesses
- **Follow-through journalism**: DiFilippo also covered related story "New Jersey's Worst Nursing Home" (Dec 12, 2024) exposing similar fraud at Bridgeton facility ($35.6M Medicaid intake, $38.9M paid to owner-controlled businesses)
- **Pattern recognition**: Identified systematic fraud affecting multiple facilities

**Documentation:**
- State Comptroller Kevin Walsh's official report

- 46 nursing homes across 4 states implicated
- $100M+ fraud affecting NJ taxpayers
- Thousands of elderly residents subjected to substandard care
- Related fraud at 9 additional NJ nursing homes ($45.5M in inflated charges)

- Documented how private equity/management companies exploit nursing home system
- Provided evidence for legislative reform

**Accountability:**

## Story 5: Newark Mayor's Brother Investigation

**Article:** "Meet the powerful brother of Newark's mayor"
**Reporter:** [Staff - attribution not specified in available data]
**Publication Date:** May 15, 2025
**URL:** https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/15/meet-the-powerful-brother-of-newarks-mayor/
**Source:** Story Submissions CSV - only NJ Monitor submission

### Summary
Profile investigation of Mayor Ras Baraka's brother and his influence in Newark politics. Story submitted to 2025 Wrapped collection under "Politics + government" category.

### Investigative Quality: GOOD (7/10)

**Note:** Limited content available for detailed evaluation. Assessment based on:
- Story topic (examining power dynamics and political influence)
- Submission category (Politics + government)
- Timing (May 2025, just after Mayor Baraka's arrest at ICE facility)
- Subject matter (family connections to political power)

**Potential Strengths:**
- **Power structure analysis**: Examines influence beyond elected office
- **Conflict of interest potential**: Family relationships in city politics
- **Accountability**: Scrutinizes powerful but less visible figures
- **Context**: Published during heightened attention to Mayor Baraka (gubernatorial run, ICE arrest)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot fully assess investigative methodology without article content
- Unclear if exposé or profile piece
- No documented impact visible in available sources

### Sourcing: UNABLE TO FULLY ASSESS

**Would Need to Evaluate:**
- Sources used to document brother's influence
- Documentation of specific actions or contracts
- On-record vs. off-record sourcing
- Response from subjects

### Community Impact: MODERATE (6/10)

**Potential Impact:**
- **Transparency**: Sheds light on informal power structures
- **Informed electorate**: Relevant during Baraka's gubernatorial campaign
- **Accountability**: Examines nepotism/influence concerns

**Limitations:**
- No documented policy changes or responses visible
- Impact unclear without full article content
- No visible follow-up coverage

### Award Recommendation: **MODERATE PRIORITY**

**Category Fit:**
- **Political Accountability**
- **Investigative Journalism** (if documented conflicts/influence)
- **Watchdog Journalism**

**Comparative Strength:**
- Difficult to assess against past winners without full content
- Topic is relevant to accountability journalism
- May be more profile than investigation

**Why This Might Win:**
1. **Power examination**: Investigates informal political influence
2. **Timing**: Relevant to gubernatorial race
3. **Family dynamics**: Potential conflicts of interest
4. **Newark focus**: State's largest city

**Why This Might Not Win:**
1. **Limited visible impact**: No documented changes or responses
2. **Unclear methodology**: Cannot assess investigative rigor
3. **May be profile not exposé**: Unclear if it reveals wrongdoing
4. **Weaker than other submissions**: NJ Monitor's other 2025 work (Stories 1-4) appears stronger

**Recommendation:**
This story ranks 5th among the NJ Monitor submissions. While politically relevant, it does not demonstrate the same investigative depth, community impact, or accountability journalism excellence as the nursing home fraud investigation, comptroller powers story, or immigration enforcement series.
