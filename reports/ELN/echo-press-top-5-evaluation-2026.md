## Technical Note: Accessibility Success

This evaluation was made possible by overcoming previous technical limitations in accessing Echo Press articles. Using wget instead of JavaScript-dependent tools, we successfully downloaded and analyzed all 10 articles from the Wix-based website. This demonstrates the importance of persistent technical problem-solving in ensuring comprehensive journalism evaluation.

**Key Learning:** When standard web scraping tools fail (single-file-cli, Playwright), simple HTTP tools (wget with browser headers) can still access content, ensuring no outlet is excluded due to technical barriers.
