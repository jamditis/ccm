# Concept paper  
### AI implementation and experimentation: Fractional support for local news providers

### **Introduction**
The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is changing how news is produced, distributed, and consumed. Local news providers face specific challenges: they need to do more with less, compete with larger outlets that have dedicated AI teams, and navigate a landscape where new tools emerge weekly. Every single day, American journalists are using AI in new ways to streamline their workflows, improve their products and better serve their customers. At the same time, the growth of AI is upending how people interact with and understand information in sometimes dangerous ways. 

The fast pace threatens to leave many independent, local, community and ethnic media journalists behind — when you’re small, you don’t have the capacity to keep up with trends in automation and AI and apply them to your journalism and business. Big media companies have entire teams of people dedicated to integrating various AI technology and tools into their work; small ones do not. 

### **The problem and our solution**  
That’s the problem we are aiming to solve: **Small news businesses in the U.S. have no reliable source of support to integrate AI and automation tools into their work**. Grant funding focused on AI experiments comes and goes; cohorts come and go; new tools are being developed every day. 

Our solution is giving news businesses **direct access to a fractional team member who will help them stay abreast of AI technology, decide what tools would work best in their newsrooms, and then implement and troubleshoot them.** 

This AI help desk program would be run by the Center for Cooperative Media's Joe Amditis, who has spent the past three years building AI tools and training resources specifically for local newsrooms. He has developed interactive tools that help journalists choose the right AI models for their projects, created template libraries for AI-assisted development, and built production applications for news organizations across New Jersey.

## **How it would work**

The AI help desk would provide four types of ongoing support:

### **Weekly newsletter**
A curated email summarizing the most relevant AI developments for local newsrooms. Each issue would explain what's actually useful versus what's hype, include links to tutorials and resources, and highlight successful implementations from other small news organizations. The goal is to save editors and publishers the time of tracking dozens of AI announcements and help them focus on tools that could work for their specific situations.

### **Monthly webinars**
Live demonstrations of AI tools in action, with Q&A sessions. Topics would range from practical workflows (using AI to transcribe interviews, draft social media posts, or clean up messy data) to strategic decisions (when to invest in a paid tool versus using free alternatives). Sessions would be recorded and archived for on-demand access. Guest speakers from newsrooms already using AI would share what worked and what didn't.

### **Monthly open building hours**
Drop-in virtual sessions where newsroom staff can get hands-on help with specific projects. These sessions would allow participants to work through implementation challenges together, troubleshoot issues in real time, and learn from what others are building. A newsroom trying to automate their newsletter production, for example, could get direct guidance on setting up the workflow.

### **Help desk intake system**
An asynchronous support channel for newsrooms with specific questions. Requests would be triaged and responded to within 48-72 hours. Common questions would be documented and turned into resources for the broader community. Complex projects that need more than a quick answer could be escalated to the building hours or scheduled for one-on-one consultation.

### **Example scenario:** A two-person newsroom wants to use AI to help produce a Spanish-language version of their English newsletter. Through the help desk, they submit their question. Within a few days, they receive recommendations for translation tools suited to their budget, a walkthrough of how to set up a workflow, and an invitation to the next building hours session where they can get help with implementation. The following month's webinar features their story as a case study.

## **Who we would serve**

The AI help desk would prioritize small, independent news organizations that lack in-house technical staff. This includes:

- **Solo operators and micro-newsrooms** (1-5 staff) who wear multiple hats and have no dedicated technology role
- **Community and hyperlocal outlets** covering specific neighborhoods, towns, or regions
- **Ethnic media organizations** serving immigrant and non-English-speaking communities
- **Student and emerging outlets** building capacity for the first time

In Year 1, we would aim to actively support 50-75 newsrooms through direct help desk interactions, while reaching a broader audience of 500+ through the newsletter and webinars. The program would be open nationally, with priority given to newsrooms in under-resourced communities.

## **Why now**

The window for helping small newsrooms adopt AI effectively is narrowing. Large news organizations are already several years into AI implementation, with dedicated teams and significant budgets. Every month that passes widens the gap.

At the same time, the AI tool landscape is maturing. The chaotic early period of 2023-2024, when new tools launched weekly and best practices were unclear, is giving way to more stable options with clearer use cases. This is the right moment to help small newsrooms catch up — the tools are ready, but the support infrastructure doesn't exist.

Without intervention, many small news organizations will either adopt AI tools poorly (creating quality and ethics problems) or skip them entirely (falling further behind larger competitors). The help desk would provide the guidance needed to adopt AI thoughtfully.

## **Measuring success**

We would track program effectiveness through:

###  **Reach metrics:**
- Newsletter subscribers (target: 500 by end of Year 1)
- Webinar attendance (target: average 40 per session)
- Building hours participation (target: average 15 per session)
- Help desk requests received and resolved (target: 100+ in Year 1)

### **Outcome metrics:**
- Newsrooms reporting successful AI implementation after using the help desk
- Tools or workflows adopted based on program recommendations
- Time saved on routine tasks (self-reported by participating newsrooms)

### **Quality metrics:**
- Satisfaction ratings from help desk users
- Repeat engagement (newsrooms returning for additional support)
- Case studies documenting successful implementations

We would report on these metrics quarterly and adjust programming based on what we learn about participant needs.

## **Beyond Year 1**

If demand meets expectations, we would expand the program in Years 2 and 3:

### **Year 2 ($165,000):**
- Add 1-2 part-time staff to handle increased help desk volume
- Launch a peer cohort model pairing newsrooms working on similar projects
- Develop self-service resources based on common help desk requests
- Target: 100-150 newsrooms served directly

### **Year 3 ($190,000):**
- Add specialized support for ethnic media (multilingual resources)
- Create train-the-trainer program for regional journalism organizations
- Develop partnerships with journalism schools for student support
- Target: 200+ newsrooms served directly, plus indirect reach through partners

## **Sustainability**

After the initial funding period, the program could sustain itself through:

- **Membership model:** Newsrooms pay a modest annual fee ($100-500 based on size) for ongoing access to help desk and resources
- **Institutional partnerships:** Regional press associations or state journalism organizations license the program for their members
- **Foundation support:** Continued grants focused on specific populations (ethnic media, rural news, etc.)
- **Fee-for-service:** Intensive consulting engagements for larger organizations subsidize free support for smaller ones

The Center's existing infrastructure and relationships reduce overhead costs, making sustainability more achievable than a standalone program.

## **Background on Joe Amditis**

Joe Amditis is the Associate Director of Operations at the Center for Cooperative Media. Over the past three years, he has focused on understanding how AI tools can help local newsrooms work more efficiently without requiring them to become software developers.

His approach centers on practical implementation rather than theoretical discussion. He builds tools that solve specific problems newsrooms face, then documents how they work so others can adapt them. Recent projects include:

**[LLM Journalism Tool Advisor](https://jamditis.github.io/tools/llm-advisor/index.html)** — An interactive decision-tree tool that helps journalists figure out which AI model is right for their project. Instead of wading through marketing materials, users answer questions about what they're trying to accomplish and receive specific recommendations with explanations of trade-offs.

**[AI resource kit for newsrooms](https://jamditis.github.io/tools/)** — A collection of 12+ downloadable templates for journalists who want to build software with AI assistance. Includes a "Vibe Coding Guide" that teaches the manager mindset (directing AI to write code rather than writing it yourself), a technical glossary with 40+ plain-language definitions, and project templates for common newsroom needs.

**[NJCIC grantees map](https://njcivicinfo.org/wp-content/grantees/map/)** — An interactive visualization of $10.7 million in grants across 73+ organizations funded by the New Jersey Civic Information Consortium. Demonstrates how AI-assisted development can produce civic technology tools that would typically require a professional development team.

**NJ Reporting Fellowship Showcase** — A web platform for 15 fellowship journalists that uses AI to automatically generate story excerpts, tags, and summaries in both English and Spanish. The processing pipeline cost approximately $0.02 per story to run.

These projects share a common philosophy: start with a real problem, choose tools based on what the problem requires, and document everything so the work can be replicated or adapted.


## **Background on the Center**

The Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University's mission is to grow and strengthen local journalism and support an informed society in New Jersey and beyond. For the last 12 years, it has worked to coach, train, and support hundreds of journalists across the state and the U.S. The Center is supported primarily by funding from the Democracy Fund, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Rita Allen Foundation and the New Jersey Civic Information Consortium.

The Center has a track record of running sustained programs that provide ongoing support to newsrooms:

### **[Collaborative Journalism Summit](https://summit.collaborativejournalism.org)** — The Center co-organizes this annual conference, now in its 10th year (2017-2026), which brings together journalists from across the country to share strategies for collaboration. The 2026 summit will be held June 8-9 in Chapel Hill, NC.

### **New Jersey Reporting Fellowship** — A program that places reporters in local newsrooms to cover underreported issues. The 2025 cohort includes 15 journalists covering topics from housing to environmental justice, with their work published in outlets across the state.

### **Ethnic Media Coordination** — The Center maintains relationships with dozens of ethnic and community media outlets in New Jersey, providing training and resources tailored to their specific needs.

### **Community Tools** — The Center has built civic technology applications including an interactive map of all NJCIC grant recipients and a mutual aid coordination dashboard used by community organizations.

The Center's university affiliation provides stability and credibility, while its connections to independent, local, community, and ethnic media give it direct access to the audiences this program would serve. The AI help desk would build on these existing relationships.
