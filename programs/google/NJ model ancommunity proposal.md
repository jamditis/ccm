#  **The Community Initiative: A next generation of the New Jersey model for news**

### ***Jeff Jarvis***

### ***Senior distinguished fellow, Center for Cooperative Media, Montclair State University***

## **Executive summary**

The New Jersey model for news is a unique partnership of private, public, and academic resources devoted to improving the information ecosystem in the state. It has been held up as an example for other states, including California, as they seek to build similar support. 

This is a proposal to take the New Jersey model to the next level, building on the Google News Initiative’s 2025 investment in infrastructure here to expand the practice of journalism and open it up to new practitioners through collaboration, technology, and education. 

At a time when New Jersey is at risk of losing its public television, we see the opportunity to reimagine public media. What Montclair State University’s Center for Cooperative Media has brought together, with new and old, small and large news organizations, *is* the public’s media. Next we will open the tent wider to involve more constituents in informing communities — community organizations, local governments and businesses, schools and libraries, and citizens — and to support them in new ways, including AI and a network to share news and information. In this two-year grant, we propose to:

1. **Establish a new and interdisciplinary academic program** in community, bringing together journalism, technology, social sciences, business, and ethics to produce a next generation of graduates able to serve the public in new, more innovative, and collaborative ways;  
2. **Broaden the local information ecosystem** to enable more information stewards — not just news organizations but also government, schools and libraries, civic and charitable organizations, news influencers and content creators, students and neighbors, as well as local businesses — to more efficiently and effectively share needs and goals as well as information, and at the same time creating a blueprint for new public media by establishing the New Jersey Media Creator Network;  
3. **Exploit the new tools of artificial intelligence** to aid in aggressively expanding transparency and the availability of information in every community by augmenting both local news organizations’ and local governments’ use of automation tools and AI technology.

This initiative comes at a time when legacy media are mortally challenged, with newspapers going out of print and folding. At the same time, many new and varied organizations are forming and legacy organizations are reforming to meet communities’ needs, supported with training, coordination, and infrastructure by Montclair’s Center for Cooperative Media.

## **Background**

Montclair is the ideal proving ground for this groundbreaking program in Community. Its president, Jonathan Koppell, has made community service — serving especially nearby low-wealth communities, including Paterson and Newark — the hallmark of the University’s mission. Montclair, a Hispanic-serving institution, acquired the state’s only Black-serving institution, Bloomfield College, in 2022\. 

The University’s Center for Cooperative Media and its New Jersey News Commons (which Jeff Jarvis helped organize in 2012\) supports more than 300 new and old news and community organizations with mentorship, training, technology help, and — under a GNI grant — a new [news and data sharing network](https://medium.com/centerforcooperativemedia/nj-news-commons-nj-spotlight-news-to-launch-content-sharing-and-advertising-network-a0e4a652c31f). The Center also works with all its members on business sustainability. Under the leadership of its director, Stefanie Murray, the Center has become renowned in the nation for its innovation in broadening the scope and capabilities of local news. At the Center, assistant director Joe Amditis has been [making the tools of artificial intelligence accessible](https://centerforcooperativemedia.org/resources/ai/) to even the smallest news organizations and community information providers.

In the University’s College of Communication and Media, Dr. Carrie Brown is expanding the mission of the Engagement Journalism program she pioneered at CUNY’s Newmark Graduate School of Journalism. Thanks to her leadership, Engagement Journalism as a movement has spread to journalism schools across the country. 

And in 2025, the University established a new Interdisciplinary School for Social Transformation under the interim leadership of Dr. Laura Nicosia. It is launching a Social Impact Certificate and offering students a choice of three tracks to a bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies focusing on Health and Wellness; Exploring Human Value, Solving Human Problems; or Technology, Self, and Society. The latter track was inspired by Jarvis under a GNI grant to him at CUNY after he brought his work to Montclair and Stony Brook universities. 

The University and Center work with a wide range of collaborative partners, most prominently the [New Jersey Civic Information Consortium](https://njcivicinfo.org/), led by Christopher J. Daggett, which since 2021 has administered $10,796,392 in legislatively apportioned state funds — in addition to private funds — to support innovation in journalism through grants to both news and community organizations focused on filling New Jersey news deserts, serving marginalized communities, growing the pipeline of mediamakers and testing new methods of producing local journalism.

It is this partnership that is the foundation of the New Jersey model. The work began in 2011 when Gov. Chris Christie [turned over control of the state’s public broadcast television station to WNET](https://www.nj.com/news/2011/06/njn_is_turned_over_to_newly_cr.html) and sold its radio licenses to two public radio broadcasters for a combined $3 million, bringing attention to the crisis in news in the state and leading to the creation of the Center. This work accelerated in 2017 when the state sold off a chunk of [New Jersey’s broadcast spectrum for $332 million,](https://www.nj.com/politics/2017/04/nj_sold_two_public_television_stations_for_332m.html) which led to the legislative establishment of the Consortium. 

Since then, this work has only become more urgent as the state’s largest news organizations — The Star-Ledger/[NJ.com](http://NJ.com) and Gannett’s properties including The Record — have continued to dramatically downsize, and as political pressure has resulted in a weakening of public record laws, the wholesale ending of legal advertisements’ statue-mandated connection to newspapers and the impending closure of NJ PBS due to budget cuts. 

## **Program proposal**

We propose an initiative made up of three components:

#### ***Education***

We seek to develop a new community-focused education program. It will be journalism-adjacent — that is, its mission is to expand the definition of journalism past content creation and the practice of journalism past newsrooms, involving all stakeholders in collaborative efforts to improve their communities. The education program will build on the foundation of Dr. Brown’s pioneering work in establishing Engagement Journalism, involving other disciplines from across the University, in the hope of providing a new model for education to schools across the country. Through class projects, capstone practica, and — as part of this grant proposal — funded internships and postgraduate fellowships, students will have the opportunity to practice their community skills serving an unlimited range of local and online publics. We also plan for the program to support faculty research, such as a study of New Jersey news influencers now being undertaken by Dr. Brown. 

The form the program will take is yet to be determined under faculty governance. It could compose a fourth track in the new Interdisciplinary School for Social Transformation — alongside the track in Technology, Self, and Society — and/or a major, a minor, or a certificate. The ultimate goal could be to build Master’s and PhD degree programs. 

Funding will be used to provide faculty and staff time to develop the program; research grants; travel funds for both faculty and students; events; and paid internships and postgraduate fellowships. 

#### ***Education budget***

| ITEM | COST |
| :---- | ----: |
| Faculty time (buying out at least 4 semesters of one course each at $6K per course, plus two months of summer time for two years) | $36,000 |
| Research grants (3 at $5K each) | $15,000 |
| Travel funds | $12,000 |
| Internships (2 for 2 years at $5K each) | $20,000 |
| Post-grad fellowship (2 for $26,500) | $53,000 |
| Salary for Jeff Jarvis ($25K a year for two years) | $50,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$186,000** |

#### ***Ecosystem expansion to creators***

The next step for the New Jersey model for news is to augment its support of hundreds of individual news sites and organizations by bringing them together with many additional stakeholders — [information stewards](https://www.commoner.company/blog/info-stewards-report) who are already holders of trust working in community organizations, schools and libraries, and state and local government bodies. 

One of the most impactful ways to approach this in the current environment is through seeking out, training, incentivizing, and partnering with content creators (also called influencers).

Dr. Brown and Prof. Tara George are in the process of conducting research that analyzes the landscape for content creators who touch on news or local news in New Jersey. Early findings show a dearth of such creators and a wide-open space to help support new ones.  

Additionally, Montclair is leading a statewide working group to reimagine NJ PBS as WNET is ending its contract with the state of New Jersey to operate NJ PBS on June 30, 2026\.  One of the items that the University and WNET are examining together is how to create the new future of public media for residents of the Garden State. 

The Center believes that a wholesale reimagining of public media, paired with a community-centered focus that prioritizes content creators, could be an innovative way to expand the ecosystem in the way described above. Montclair, the Center, the Consortium and others are seeking a planning grant from outside funders to take on this work; Google’s contribution would specifically focus on support for a new corp of information stewards. This would be an effort to recruit, train, and mentor a pilot group of statewide community of creators in partnership with the statewide working group, NJ PBS, the Consortium, and some of the emerging training programs (such as the News Creators Corp., Project C, the American Press Institute, or Adriana Lacey’s influencer relations work), launching the New Jersey Media Creator Network.

#### ***Ecosystem expansion budget***

| ITEM | COST |
| :---- | ----: |
| Engagement and network coordinator | $30,000 |
| Event budget (including incentives for community members and information stewards to attend) | $20,000 |
| Training budget | $50,000 |
| Student workers ($3K a semester, 2 per semester for 4 semesters) | $24,000 |
| Fellowships for creators (Up to 5 at $20K each) | $100,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$224,000** |

#### ***Transparency & AI initiative***

The Center will bring together a pilot group of innovative local news organizations, beginning with NJ Spotlight News and the New Jersey Hills Media Group (a legacy newspaper company recently acquired by a not-for-profit and undergoing radical transformation) to experiment with new community-focused structures for sharing local data and information, from recordings and AI-generated transcriptions and summaries of local board meetings to alerts of zoning variances and complete databases of local menus, supplemented by tools and [AI-assisted frameworks built by Joe Amditis](https://centerforcooperativemedia.org/ai). We are investigating CalMatter’s pioneering work in its [Digital Democracy tool](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/) as a core component. We call this Transparency as a Service. 

NJ Spotlight News covers the state, and the Hills Media Group covers 51 suburban municipalities, providing several options to test this idea. Additionally, the Consortium is in conversations with Mercer County around the idea of collaboration with local journalists to improve coverage of, and attendance at, public meetings. 

Additionally, this project will provide hands-on, fractional support for New Jersey local news organizations to better leverage AI and automation in their workflows. So many of the AI initiatives for local news across the U.S. have focused solely on large newsrooms, such as the Microsoft/Lenfest and Microsoft/American Journalism Project partnerships. This will be the first effort targeted specifically to support small, local newsrooms and blogs, concentrating not on shiny new AI toys but rather on using existing tools to improve workflow and community connection; this is where Amditis has excelled. 

Amditis has established himself as a leading voice at the intersection of artificial intelligence and local journalism. His contributions span education, research, and practical implementation of AI technologies in newsrooms.

Much of what is envisioned in this initiative is made possible only recently by advances in artificial intelligence and large language models.

**This effort could include:** 

* Using Gemini/NotebookLM to transcribe video recordings of local government meetings and provide summaries, highlights, next steps, and even podcasts to both engage residents in local policy and free up the ever-shrinking corps of local journalists from mundane to more valuable coverage.  
* News organizations and schools are scraping and organizing public records and documents, such as ordinances, local spending, and requests for zoning variances. With the help of AI coding at the Center, towns may provide newsletters and personalized alerts based on such data.   
* The Center’s AI program can help every news and community organization in the state — as well as local businesses — provide better access to their information, including newsletters and text alerts.   
* We can use the translation abilities in Gemini and Google Translate to help news organizations, local governments, and community organizations engage in *two-way* translation and communication, not only providing existing information in more languages but also enabling reporters and community leaders to hear the needs of constituents in any of the 128 languages spoken in the state.  
* As mentioned above, this effort can learn from and build off of CalMatters’ pioneering work in its [Digital Democracy tool,](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/) which was recently launched in Hawaii. Although that is a statewide tool, its lessons can easily be broken down for municipal-level work.   
* Exploration of building the content-sharing network into an API for news to supply credible reporting and data to AI companies.

In addition to funding, this work would benefit from Google’s technical training and support through GNI and NotebookLM so New Jersey can become a showcase for the effective and responsible use of AI in providing local information and collaboration. 

Funding will provide additional staffing to work with the Center to provide shared programming and infrastructure for these technology initiatives, to train AI users in local news organizations and governments, and to host the shared services.

| **TOTAL** | **$189,000** |

## **Collaboration**

This is envisioned to be a collaborative initiative with many potential partners. In addition to the University, the Center, the NJ Civic Information Consortium, and pilot news organizations, we are investigating working with organizations doing complementary work. One example is the [News Creator Corps](https://newscreatorcorps.org/about/#mission), led by Rachel Lobdell, Jay Rosen, and Annemarie Dooling. It is developing an educational program to bring training in fundamental skills of journalism and credibility to local news influencers. Dr. Brown’s research on news influencers in New Jersey will identify candidates for training. Another example is Cole Goins and the Journalism and Design Lab at the New School, which is working with [community colleges to serve as local news and information hubs](https://journalismdesign.com/how-might-community-colleges-serve-as-local-news-and-information-hubs-in-the-southwest/). Another is CalMatters and its Digital Democracy tool. Each program represents an effort to expand the practice of journalism past newsrooms, into communities.
