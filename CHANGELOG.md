## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

No breaking changes for end users. The app maintains the same interface and behavior, with expanded functionality.

For developers:

1. **Component imports** - Update imports if extending:
   ```javascript
   // Old
   import App from './App';

   // New - specific components available
   import Header from './components/Header';
   import ToolCard from './components/ToolCard';
   ```

2. **Decision tree** - Now in separate file:
   ```javascript
   // Old - inline in App.jsx
   const decisionTree = { ... }

   // New - imported from data
   import { decisionTree } from './data/decisionTree';
   ```

3. **State management** - Changed to useReducer:
   ```javascript
   // Old
   const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState("start");
   const [history, setHistory] = useState([]);

   // New
   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(decisionReducer, initialState);
   const { currentStep, history } = state;
   ```
