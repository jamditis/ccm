  - Foundation director
  - Community affairs/corporate social responsibility staff
  - Multicultural outreach staff
  - Communications/PR contacts
  - Direct emails and phone numbers when available

- **Grant Programs & Funding Priorities**
  - Program areas (health, education, community development, arts, media, etc.)
  - Grant ranges ($X to $Y)

### 2. Form 990 Research (When Applicable)

  - Organizations in similar sectors
  - Grant amounts (to understand typical funding levels)
  - Geographic distribution
  - Types of projects funded
  - Any media/journalism support
- Note any employee matching gift programs
- Identify foundation assets and giving capacity

### 3. Application Process Investigation
Determine:

- **Open application** vs. **invitation-only**
- **Online portal** vs. **email submission** vs. **no unsolicited proposals**
- Required documents (IRS determination letter, audit, budget, etc.)
- Application format (LOI first, full proposal, concept paper)

- Contact for inquiries

### 4. NJ-Specific Considerations
For New Jersey-focused research:

  - Health disparities in NJ
  - Education gaps
  - Economic development
  - Environmental justice

### 5. Fit Assessment Criteria
Evaluate alignment based on:

- **Mission Alignment** (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ to ⭐)
  - Does their mission align with your event/program?
  - Do they fund similar initiatives?
  - Do they support media/journalism/communications?

- **Geographic Fit**
